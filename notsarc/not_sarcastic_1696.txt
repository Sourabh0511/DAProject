i'm not sure how quotes from the other side of the same capitalist, warmongering coin as the republicans has any bearing on any church's support for war. the catholic church, and the us national council of churches (representing most protestant churches) opposed the war. the only church that was apparently in favour were the southern baptists, darling of the 'christian' right.
