There are precious few areas on the planet that have not been explored. Those that haven't would not support the kinds of life we are talking about. There is no evidence of any interim species of apes and humans. Not one shred. Those items in the fossil record that are claimed as possibles are only possibles, are dubious at best, and are extremely rare. A recent study also showed that most characteristics of supposed alternate species of hominids were well within the variation seen in current homo sapiens. The point I was making is that if they existed we would see them.
