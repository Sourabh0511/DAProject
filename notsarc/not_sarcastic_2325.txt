"Inconsistent how? If you give me specific quotes of mine that were inconsistent, I will be more able to respond. I never said I didn't know. I said there is no empirical evidence. That is not synonymous with not knowing. The word ""proof"" as I am using it is subjective. What if proof enough for me is not for you. What is proof for me is not empirical. According to my definition, I have proof. It's just not proof that you will accept. It comes down to a simple difference of epistemology. I believe that personal metaphysical evidences can be accepted, you don't. End of story."
