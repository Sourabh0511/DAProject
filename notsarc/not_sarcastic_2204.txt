if you check again you will find they do have self defense shootings in the list as well as accidents. the point is, as even you have now pointed out, the number is flawed. the source, vpc, knowingly used false data to further their claim. therefore eliminating any validity to their claim.  you and brady continue to trot out biased and inaccurate sources to back your arguement. you should stop, it does great harm to your credibility. wow, you really can leap tall mounds of logic in a single bound. what evidence do you have that any of these deaths would have been prevented by banning concealed carry? then also consider the lives saved by concealed carry, such as mine.
