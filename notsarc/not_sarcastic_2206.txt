To be honest...I don't know. But I do know that to argue something is false because the consequences are not desired is a logical fallacy (Appeal to Consequences).So is the argument I posted earlier (posted below for quick reference) true or false? And if false, why?A) Only science should be taught in science class (this is why creationism should not be taught in science class).B) Science is a collection of testable theories which have been thoroughly observed, identified, described, experimentally investigated and remain unrefuted.Conclusion: If A is true and B is valid then science class should only consist of testable theories which have been thoroughly observed, identified, described, experimentally investigated and remain unrefuted.
