my parents moved to shawnee not long ago. when i was a kid, anything west of lenexa was considered too close to desoto, and a little suspect :) i was up that way not long ago, and even deoto is fairly respectable now :) :)  i am surprised there are so many here from kansas. there is somebody here from lenexa as well.
