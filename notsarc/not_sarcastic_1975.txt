do you believe the average individual actually has any personal control over providing basic essentials and security? most individuals exist from proceeds of a 'job' or government programs and would be lost without one or the other, of which they generally have no actual influence.  i find it difficult to accept that the average, individual us citizen has the brain power to be concerned about anything but what's on tv. voter apathy of 25% or less participation in municipal elections are a strong indication of individual need to be manipulated as governing powers see fit.
