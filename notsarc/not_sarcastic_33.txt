But recognition of the big bang as a very good explanation of cosmology isn't limited to evolutionsits. In fact, most other scientists also believe so, most especially cosmologists and astrophysicists, who are directly concerned with the early universe. Evolutionists, even though the origin of matter and time are irrelevant to the study of evolution, are also educated in science and probably accept the work done by these other scientists.
