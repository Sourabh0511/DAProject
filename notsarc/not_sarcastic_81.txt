We share a border with Mexico. The drug cartel is armed with missile and grenade launchers. But when was the last time 72 of our police officers were murdered on American soil, in a single day, at a single location?   The countries with the greatest number of legal gun ownership, they're absent these mass killings that take place on a regular basis. There's no rebels in America killing entire cities worth of people without opposition; not even in the small towns that're without a local police force.   Explain that one away.
