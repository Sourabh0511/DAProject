i think you may be very very suprised by roberts. i like some of the answers he is giving. i have a feeling you conservates may get f***cked. he is not as conservate as you think. besides even if he is conservate he certainly is not as conservate as the emoticonxcensored he is replacing.  as a citizen of virginia do you support this law that strips people of their wills and powers of attorny? http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp...41+ful+hb751s1 this is just a very mean law and will hurt many people.
