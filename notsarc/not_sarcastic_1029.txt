"Actually in high school I had a friend who used to be in placement. He was sixteen years old an he said he got the s*** beat out of him by an eight year old boy. ""Street kids"" get their XXX beat every day, pain is nothing new to them. It seems they're immune to it. It doesn't matter how hard you can hit, if you can't take a punch, then you can't call yourself street-worthy."
