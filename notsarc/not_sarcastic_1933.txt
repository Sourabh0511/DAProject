i believe that evolution is a perfectly logical idea. (from the science point of view)all humans are traced to monkeys from africa. from there they spread throughout the world. if it is not evolution, then why do humans from high elevations have larger lungs? how come africans have a darker skin tone? how come humans from cold regions have a thicker coat of hair? i doubt it is coinsidental, and no offense, but i dont think that a god did this for us. every person has a subconscience. in this subconscience we think of lesser facts. does that mean that it is possible for the subconscience to create the genetic material used for reproduction a way to survive better? i believe so.
