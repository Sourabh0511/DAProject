pay attention. age of consent is still the topic and point. if teen pregnancy is reduced to statistically acceptable levels through education and contraception with medical risk being a negligible five-decimal point factor, that would position teen sex emotional distress as a good/bad societal interpretation designated by non-teens, would it not? which would negate chronological age of consent for legal sex to a non-status unless those non-teens making the laws had another agenda.
