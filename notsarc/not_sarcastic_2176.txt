that speaks a lot about you and shows other posters they shouldn't take what you say at face value. yes it does. if i go before congress and say 'being gay is a choice without a doubt made at age 11' and had no evidence than i should be laughed at. same thing as this woman. she makes a claim with no evidence and reason to lie. this makes you not credible.  than a legislative body? while probably true, this is sad because newspapers have none.
