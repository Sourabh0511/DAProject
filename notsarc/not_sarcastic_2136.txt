hold on there. have you read the amendment? if all of our legistlators passed laws based on single incidents, our nanny government would be exponentially more intrusive than it already is.  now i don't know this woman's story any more than you do. all you know is that at least one defense contractor has a clause in it's employee contract banning an employee from shoooting for the brass ring in a jury trial. it doesn't state that the rapists can't be prosecuted.
