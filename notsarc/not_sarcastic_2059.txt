Right so...1) God will kill you before he gives you a chance to repent? Thus sending you straight to hell. I like that!2) God seems to make life unfair for most everyone. Hey, even in America. Consider in America, and extrememly religious state, you still have the highest homocide rates out of ALL the western countries. (I'm pretty sure of this.)3) Left behind? So, wait. The riegtous go the heaven, and everyone else remains leading a normal, religion free life on earth? Hmmm...4) Hebrews?5) Can it help? The gospels tell a story about a carpenter who lived 2000 years ago, and may or may not have been the son of god. Yeah, I can see how that can help. Why can't I worship the Flying Spaghetti Monster?
