thanks for that, jason. in esdraelon's defense, there are hundreds of authors of other religions who choose to take portions of our writ out of context, and morph them into something that looks like what he described. (a self-made god who has an alotted portion of the universe.) this is not the actual belief of lds. this is a skewed and exaggerated oversimplification of our doctrine of eternal progression. it's also what seems to be most commonly understood when an lds tries to briefly explain the doctrine.  in other words, i'm not surprised that esdraelon was under that impression.
