is this a case of the truth hurting? then i guess it would work both ways. how do you feel about 'christians' slagging off non-believers, declaring that they will end up in hell for denying god? conceited? yup. could i give a toss? nope. how do you think non-believers feel about the smugness of christians? and it's not just me who thinks they're fairytales and that christians are delusional, as you well know. so why personalise it? apart from that, a lot of us here have a thick skin. this is a debating forum, and there is little room for those with delicate sensibilities who feel insulted at the pov of others.
