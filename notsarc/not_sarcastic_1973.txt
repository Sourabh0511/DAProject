like most things in christianity as the catholic church got organized. http://kevinantoine.com/holytrinity.htm now why does that matter? the burden of proof is yours to prove that god exists and the bible is his communication to man. you have made absolutely no progress towards that end. do not think my speculation on the evolution of the internal inconsistencies of christianity in any way substitutes for that responsibility.
