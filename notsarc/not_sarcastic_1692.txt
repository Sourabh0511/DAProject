i'm nothing if not a thoughtful atheist, but it's not skepticism that drove me from religion, but revulsion, and i absolutely refuse to let fear, the lowest of emotions and religions favorite trump card, to have any sway over my life when it comes to determining my religious beliefs. fear of judgement day is just one more trick religion has to get us to submit, and while i'm not surprised it worked to control illiterate savages and barbarians thousands of years past, i'm astounded so many people in this day an age allow themselves to fall prey to pascals wager.
