*shudder* for whom the bell tolls might be the most horrid book ever devised. junior year english took a lot out of me. an excerpt from the book, paraphrased to the best of my memory: 'darling.' 'yes.' 'i love you.' 'oh.' 'do you?' yes.' 'you love me.' 'i love you.' 'let's hide. in this cave. while the war goes on. and die. alone. in the rain.' 'wait.' 'what?' 'how do we die alone? we're together.' 'oh yeah.' 'i love you.' 'i love you too.' my god, i wanted to tear my eyes out. so instead, i just stopped reading it. ;)  who wrote timeline? i just finished the pelican brief, by john grisham. what an amazing book.
