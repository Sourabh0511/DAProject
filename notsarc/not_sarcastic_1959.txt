good question.  let us say that dawkins is my teacher.  in the ben stien interview , dawkins said that evolution is fact, as much of a fact, as we can know anything to be a fact... ok?!?! dawkins also says that we do not know how life originates from inornanic, nonliving compounds and he says, that, he doesn't know and no one else does either. ok!!?! well i do not accept that as an explanation - so - i guess i am not blindly following this irrational line of logic. i would have to say that - i am not being 'indoctinated'. at the same time, dawkins has nothing to teach me so i guess i am not being 'educated' either. hmmm. i guess i would have to say that in this case i am - neither.
