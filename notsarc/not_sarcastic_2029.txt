Well for one thing religion is specificly mentioned in the constitution, not as 100% protected but in that gov't cannot mandate a religion. Also, religion is not unilateraly protected, as I've stated several times. There are many restrictions put on religion by government and if government can restrict religion then why not which marriages they recognise? That being said I have long been a supporter of limited gov't and believe that gov't has no business endorsing or giving advantages to any marriage. They should be silent on the subject.
