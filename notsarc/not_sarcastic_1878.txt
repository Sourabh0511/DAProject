oh yes i forgot there are some who believe that the property of free-will permeates the universe and is shared by all things animate or otherwise. there is a mathematical proof floating around someplace of it. but since i do not think that there is in fact such thing as free-will i have not bothered to collect it. humans do not have free-will simply because there is nothing for human will to be free of.
