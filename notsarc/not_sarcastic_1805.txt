quiet the opposite. fossil records give us a snap shoct of location in time going way back. molecular biology, geology, radiography do so as well. where do you get the idea that there is no evidence? everything we have in our heads is what has been taught to us. shoulder's of giants, hun. it is observed. you and i have about one hundred non fatal mutations in our genotype. remember, most mutations are innocuous. not so. only one of a pathogenetic organism needs this and as mutation is pretty common in rappid generation organisms (bacteria) situations the 'chances' are very much in favour of it happening. remember, mutations are happening to every bacteria every generation at random.
