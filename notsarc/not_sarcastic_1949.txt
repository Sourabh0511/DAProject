why do so many lifers just skip right past the pregnancy as if it has no impact? i am not talking about parenting. i don't advocate forcing anyone to parent. ever. that is why i support safe haven laws, signing away of parental rights, etc. i am talking about pregnancy. only a woman can be pregnant and should have the ultimate say in whether or not she is. it is her body, not your's, not the state's, not the church's, and not the fetus'.  when it comes to pregnancy - you wish only to legislate the bodies/reproductive organs of women. i bet you would not advocate chemical castration for any male who is not yet ready to be a parent.
