arafat is not a worse leader than sharon... arafat steals millions in aid money that is suppose to go to the palestinians, which 80% of them are below the poverty line. arafat advocates people to xxxx themselves up so that they may kill as many jews as possible. he is the head-figure of many of these terrorist groups and pours millions of aid into them.  sharon is worse? not only has arafat contributed to many more than 1,000 israeli casualties, his 'intifada' has continued the cycle of violence and thus caused the death of more than 2,000 palestinians.
