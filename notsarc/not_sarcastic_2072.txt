i'm sorry, but i find this completely ridiculous and unfounded. i can see (remotely) how abortion might be considered anti-woman (although it is of course anti-life before being anything else), but how has christianity directly sanctioned the questions of women's suffrage, spousal abuse, property ownership, social status, etc.? by the way, do you consider fundamentalists to be the best representatives of a religion? i am catholic, and i believe i understand the dogmas and principles of my faith quite enougth to say that nothing of what you have mentioned (except abortion, because it has nothing to do with women's rights) are viewed positively by the catholic church, or ever have been. please explain with details.
