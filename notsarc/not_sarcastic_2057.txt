How long has the boyfriend been 16? Is he closer to 15 or 17?How long has nocturnal09 been 14? Is she closer to 13 or 15?If nocturnal09 will be 15 in a couple of days or so and the boyfriend just turned 16 about a month ago, then the 14 vs 16 thing isn't really the biggest deal. Depending on when their b-days fall, they could both be in the same graduating class. He could have been born in May 1990 while she was born in July 1991. Therefor, he is 16 but she will still be 14 for at least another half of a month. Now, none of this information was given. All I'm saying is that the 2 year gap (until more info is given there) can not be considered the biggest problem.
