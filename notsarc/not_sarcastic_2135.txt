walking-fish: has anyone ever observed two atoms combining to form a molecule? has anyone ever counted out 6.02 x 10^23 molecules to see if they really make up a mole? has anyone ever watched the earth for a year from outer space to see if it really does go around the sun? has anyone ever seen electrons in a copper wire when an eletric current is passed through it? all scientific disciplines are held together by theories which are inferences about things we cannot directly observe. what is it about science that you don't understand?
