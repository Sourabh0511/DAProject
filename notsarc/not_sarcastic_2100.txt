"You benefit from all of these. They may not be direct benefits or even benefits you want but when it exists we all benefit. Frankly, the IRS is just an idiotic one. Your whole argument only works if you have the IRS to enforce these policies. Could we go without SS and Public education? Probably, but I prefer a system where society decides on what is a ""public good"" and we go with that."
