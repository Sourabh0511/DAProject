there is one major difference between the democratic spending plans and the republican plan (for this election cycle anyway): dems want to repeal the tax cuts, so they have a methodology for paying for all of this. oh, and they haven't been too keen on sending men to mars either. and just a quick aside, was it legal to invade iraq? probably, b/c of the legislation broker cites. but i think he makes a logical leap when he extrapolates 'justified' from 'legal.' the calculus used to say this was a 'just' war is a very dangerous one, and if cross-applied could justify innumerable conflicts (how many nations can legitmately say that another nation has 'dangerous activities' that make it pose an 'imminent threat'? at the very least, the entire mid-east (arab/israel) would explode under that logic).
