i'm not surprised. we're living in an age when communication outside of our local group is becoming increasingly common. people are starting to hear ideas they never would have before. religion has generally survived because people's experiences were limited to the views of those immediately around them, those who pretty much shared those same views. today, and for a while now, that's been changing and people are hearing other things causing them to rethink what they've been taught.
