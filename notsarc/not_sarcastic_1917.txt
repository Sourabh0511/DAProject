quite frankly,i am astounded by you homosexuals (or homosexual supporters) who claim to hate judging yet judge religious people.....those who judge and those who don't... if i were to say a controversial statement such as 'whats the point of entering an exit?' you would have been hurt or angered..yet you would make disrespectful,hatred-provoking comments that was quite the opposite of the message you were spewing just arguments prior to your comment.
