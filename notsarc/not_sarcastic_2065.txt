Hello, ungerdunn.Hmm. It is possible that I will be living in Oklahoma in 2006. How easy is it to get to Houston from there?I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Tanzania. One of my biggest regrests is that I never made it to Olduvai Gorge. It would have been interesting to pay a visit to the ancestral homeland!
