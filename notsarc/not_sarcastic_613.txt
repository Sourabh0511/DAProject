Quite frankly, you don't know squat about me. So stop trying to pretend you do.I have gone on record to say I think Christianity does a lot of good in the world.I have even tried to correct Matthew in his anti-Christian tirades. (Until I gave up realizing it would do no good... emoticonXFrazzled )I hate to break it to you, but the WORLD typically functions with people putting out negative news.You hear about how Joe XXXX broke the law.Do you ever hear about how Johnny Atlas keeps the law?emoticonXFrazzled
