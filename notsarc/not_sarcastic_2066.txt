persecution on political grounds? we are talking about a kingpin of russian organized crime here. he has been indicted in russia for fraud and political corruption (bribing politicians) and there is absolutly no question that he is guilty as sin. now he is hiding in britain and actively planning a violent coup in order to overthrow the elected government...and he lays all this out to a british newspaper.  political persecution if he returns? probably not. execution for treason? that one seems more likely.  in the extradition rhetoric arena, the russians are looking a lot more reasonable then the british.
