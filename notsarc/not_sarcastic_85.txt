"True. Gallup couches the questions in a way that favors spiritualism. That is his preference and I think that his polls are slanted that way. I don't think I have ever seen a poll that actually asked the question directly and ""no religion"" doesn't really ask it. The numbers are just guesses. I think Big Orn is correct 7 to 10% is probably a bit low."
