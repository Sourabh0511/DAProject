'if it's beside the point' the why bring it up, jyoshu. why 'talk out of both sides of your mouth'?  and your right wing talking points are stale and tired. comparing different civil rights movements is not 'piggybacking'. and incidentally, why is it that all of the blacks in congress for equal rights for glbt people? why is it that they are the most passionate defenders of glbt people? there are black gay people who suffered along with the straight black people. there are female gay people that suffered along with the women. on top of such discrimination, gay people may have had no family support. some were probably lobotomized against their wishes. some were raped, some were probably murdered by people they thought would understand what discrimination was all about. no, my friend. it is disingenuous to say with certainty that you know they have not.
