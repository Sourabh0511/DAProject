Just making sure that everybody is aware of his evasion, misrepresentation, and dishonesty. I figured a good time to do that would be while he was accusing scientists of these things... (I figure it's a damn good illustration when a paper's author tells him to stop misrepresenting the paper, and he keeps doing it anyway.)In fairness, being a creationist isn't necessarily an indicator of dishonesty; there are plenty of creationists who are creationists simply because they are uneducated about the subject. Unfortunately, supersport isn't part of this group; he has seen the evidence and is willfully ignorant of it.
