You said there that you wanted guns in schools so that kids could defend themselves. How is that a misinterpretation?   You're asking for proof of a negative. How many massacres would have occured if guns were common in school? We don't know...   Erm.... You're saying that people don't try to harm one another over those things? I suggest you surf youtube for a bit. Rememeber however, that kids are more emotionally unstable than adults. Hormones and guns aren't a good combination.   I agree that's silly. I'm more worried about your statement that students should carry in class.
