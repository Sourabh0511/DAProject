how did you overcome all the similiarities? nothing was ripped and i stated your question and my response. originally i could have made it clearer, but you could have also used the scroll bar. responses to specifics within a post dont carry forward. you would have to be willing to accept that proof. if your not then it isn't possible to prove it to your satisfaction is it. read the source i posted earlier. maybe we should let the church go back to allowing only priests to have bibles and if that doesn't work kill some skeptics.  i don't suppose jews, hindus, muslims and bhuddists qualify as non-believers or were you being area specific?
