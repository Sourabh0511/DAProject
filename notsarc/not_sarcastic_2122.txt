i'd say out of the 6 billion people on earth at least 4 billion of them are richer right now than they would be had the economic systems never changed since the era of globalization began. i don't think the number is as small as 3 people. how doesn't it lead to stability. think china and their reform to capitalism and westernization. are them more of a threat to the world as a communist nation or as a globalized nation? it will be stabilizing to have them westernize. however, it isn't necessarily good. yeah i can see what you mean. the people are just about ready to burst because the us and canada depend so much on each other. nor did i. whew, we agree on something :) isn't that the truth.
