YES! the founding fathers realized government was to serve the people it governed. With out a set of rules that limited the government it would run wild (as england did). They made the bill of rights and constitution so that it would limit the government (to keep it from becoming too powerful, and overstepping it's bounds). And the only way the constitution could actually be enforced was for the population to uphold it.Back in the time of it's writing they probably saw the best way for a population to force a government to not over step it's bounds was to force it... er... by force.Today in the information age, a much better weapon is our right to vote. Sweeping changes can be implemented with out the use of force using the system.
