ridiculous. if ic cannot support id, id has absolutely nothing going for it, right? including their supporters of ic, since all of them with the exception of you use it to support id. behe is wrong, dembski is wrong, johnson is wrong, every id supporter is wrong for using ic, because freedom the great thinks it's wrong. daewoo: ic is irreducible complexity, the idea that complex biological systems like the eye or bacterial flagellum could not have evolved through a gradual process, but had to have been formed all at once, by a designer with a function in mind. id is intelligent design, creationism with new pseudo-scientific skin, a political ploy for creationism to gain scientific respect. it failed. michael behe is an advocate of id who came up with ic.
