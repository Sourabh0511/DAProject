which is pretty much normal for arch. do you think he realizes that many muslims in europe are cultural muslims? that many who emigrate to europe are quite disgusted with what they see back in their homelands? the rise of gay muslims in europe is quite interesting as to how they have fully adopted the views of their adopted european homeland and are afraid of returning to their original home countries. the notion that arch has that once a muslim always a crazy muslim is pretty nuts, but nothing but typical from a guy who thought that tv props are good evidence for 6,000 year old acts of creation.
