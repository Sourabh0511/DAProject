Says who? People have the right to say anything they want to. There is NO right to not be judged by someone. It doesn't matter if something someone else does affects you and me or not. People can think whatever they want about other people. People can also SAY what they want. As far as a personal philosophy of behavior, I agree with you--what you're saying is a good rule to live by. But I can't agree people have no right to condemn or judge others.
