based on what? you admit there were 800,000 abortions performed in 1973 but yet if you dared to check the fertility rate between 1972 to 1973 it is nearly static; meaning there were just as many people giving birth before and after roe. surely, 800,000 potential births being aborted would have cut the fertility rate sharpely but it didn't.  you don't have to be a rocket-scientist to speculate what this means; that just as many women were having abortions between 1972 - 1973 and roe v wade only changed who was performing these abortions...not whether people were having them or not.
