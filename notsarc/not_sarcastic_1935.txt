'two other sacramento-area police officers also were implicated in illegal weapons sales but not charged because they didn't turn large profits,' ah it's ok to sell illegal weapons as long as you don't make a big profit?  'california law bars citizens from buying handguns that have not been deemed safe by the state department of justice, but the law exempts peace officers.' the cops there are above the law? had to put a new hard drive and install,good to be back.
