what is capitalism? can there be something like 'responsible capitalism' and, if so, what would 'responsible capitalism' be? my view is that the term 'capitalism' has a multitude of meanings dependent upon who is defining it and that 'capitalism' could have a multitude of modifiers to further refine its meaning. is to be a capitalist to be utterly free of responsibility and blame for the evils that capitalism may cause?
