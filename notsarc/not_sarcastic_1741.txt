i'm not surprised. i have more than that, i also have common sense on my side. firearms don't facilitate killing, firearms facilitate keeping criminals from getting a corner market on domination. the police are outnumbered by the criminals, the criminals are outnumbered by the law-abiding citizens. we shouldn't be unarmed when we're the majority force in maintaining the balance. too bad.
