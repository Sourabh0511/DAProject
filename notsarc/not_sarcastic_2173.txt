avoiding what question, penfold? emoticonxbanghead how is asking iangb to take it to the 'challenger's corner' an avoidance? i see it as a chance to amplify the discussion. at any rate, it's a lot easier to answer a question if you know what is being asked. so,... feel free to repeat the question that you are accusing me of trying to avoid.
