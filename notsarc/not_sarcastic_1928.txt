'Most Biblical scholars'? If you mean they think the letters are forgeries and weren't at least dictated by Paul, then it's just not true that most Biblical scholars think that. I agree in terms of the idea that Paul in some cases had someone else actually put the words on paper and he told them what to write, but that's pretty irrelevant here, IMO.
