but that doesn't answer the question. why is dawkins a xxxxx to believe as he does? it seems that you have no answer except to throw out indiscriminate insults at people you know nothing about. in a previous post you stated, 'the guys a simpleton.' that doesn't make sense as there is no verb in the sentence. 'guys' is the plural of 'guy'. you don't seem to be aware that the contraction for 'guy is' is 'guy's.' your error is caused by ignorance whereas trebor's is clearly a typo caused by the proximity of the 'e' and 'd' keys. do you have a better explanation for our origins that doesn't involve magic and dirt?
