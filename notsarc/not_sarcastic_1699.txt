why not invite a bunch of famous people? de niro is an incredibly interesting guy; my brother used to work on many films with him as a lighting specialist. he was one of the few folks that actually got to know him. scorsese, on the other hand, i'm sure, like you said, has tons of stories and anecdotes, all of which i'd love to hear! i've got my fair share of intellectual, spiritually magnificent people: ghandi, nietzsche and morello are all fantastic people.
