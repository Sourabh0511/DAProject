Exactly. Trying to prove that God, if he exists, didn't make us as good as an all powerful being should have made us doesn't prove anything in the God debate. I could always debate that since God is all powerful and all knowing he could have always thought of something better to do. If he made those changes, then of course there would still be something better he could have thought of. This would be an endless loop of creating something better and better until finally he would have to stop and say that is good enough. But even then this debate that he didn't make us as good as he could have would be valid in my view.
