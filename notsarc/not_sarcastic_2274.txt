do you know what a fatwa is ? the burden of proof is on those who want an invasion, iran can not prove that is not trying to develop a nuclear weapon. you can not prove a negative. honestly i don't think people have learned the lesson from the iraq war.  what did we hear before that invasion from the warmongers in the us and uk ?  the exact same thing we are hearing at the moment. that the regime is evil, they have wmd, they have links to aq etc surely the people are not dumb enough to fall for the same tripe again ?
