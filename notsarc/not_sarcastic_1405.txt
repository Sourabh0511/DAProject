"See Above.I can't help but notice your signature. What are you, Patriot under a different username? Bad show, Patriot. Sock Puppets aren't good debate form.Patriot-- About your statement that you've been vindicated. I hope you're just fooling around. :)TruthSeeker's first post doesn't even belong in a debate forum. She stated an opinion, and then stated absolutely nothing to back it up in any way. No evidence. No reasoning. Not one ""because"". Nothing. It was like entering a presidential candidate debate and saying, ""I think the other guy sucks"" and leaving. Hence why I asked her as politely as possible to elaborate."
