you know, i'm astonished at the fact that during an osce conference on combating discrimination and promoting mutual respect and understanding that took place in bucharest early in june, the attendees discussed all sort of things except the flagrant current situation in poland  this country gains the lead among european countries in violation of human rights in terms of anti-semitism, racism, hatred to moslems, xenophobia, homophobia, and discrimination against hiv-positive persons. this fact was evinced in poland's country report on human rights practices-2006 released by us department bureau of democracy, human rights, and labor. here i present you part of the report that has relevance to the subject. to put it short, there are quite a lot of people in poland who suffer persecution  jews, non-europeans (arabs, moslems, africans, roma), persons of alternative sexuality and hiv-positive persons.
