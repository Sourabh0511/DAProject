if genesis in the bible is not a literal account of creation (i,e., six days, man from dust, fruit of good and evil) then what is its use? why include as the foundation of the entire bible a story that is either totally fabricated, or mostly inaccurate/metaphorical? genesis 1&2, in the literal application, has 2 vitally important concepts that the entire bible is totally useless without: 1. god is sovereign and totally limitless in power 2. man has disobeyed god and is in need of reconciliation everything else in the entire bible rests on these 2 premises. now if genesis has it wrong, then what is the use of any of the rest of the bible? from all scientific perspective, genesis 1&2 never happened, and here the validity of the entire bible is questioned.
