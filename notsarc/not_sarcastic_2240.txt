you have to be kidding me. you don't really believe this, do you??? sure they may have white people on from time to time, but obviously they exclude white people since you can turn it on and almost always see only black people. so the criteria of whether something is racist or not is whether or not there is a 'single culture' behind it? i don't see why having a culture behind it is really relevant. things can be racist or not independent of whether there is a culture there.
