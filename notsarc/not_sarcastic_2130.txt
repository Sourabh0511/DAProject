"YOU LIAR.You are distorting the truth the same way Moore did. The truth is the NRA event was planned 1 year before the killings in Littleton. The truth is the NRA rally was canceled excpet for the officers meetings which is required by LAW to NOT BE CANCELED. HESTON said ""FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS"" in North Carolina 1 year later.And what transcript are you talking about? The transcript is posted above. What big pro-gun rally are you talking about in Denver. Do you mean the one that NEVER happened?"
