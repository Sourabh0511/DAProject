if the distinction matters, then what is your point about promiscuity, exactly? misinformation msleads people into thinking that if the significantly curtail the number of partners they have sex with, that they would eliminate the chance of contracting disease. that is not true. it just takes one time with an infected person. protection is what people should be arguing. it would be much better if people were upfront about sex and sexuality, upfront about their hiv status, and used protection at all times during sex.
