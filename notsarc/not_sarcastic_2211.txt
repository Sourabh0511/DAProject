up to a point, but ther are things some people would consider 'wrong' that others would not. for example, most muslims would consider drinking alcohol to be wrong, while most non-muslims would not. some people believe it is wrong to hit someone, whether or not they have hit you, others believe you have a right to retaliate. some believe that sex is a big deal and should be reserved only for marriage, others believe any activity between consenting adults is morally ok. all of these are moral issues. which view should schools teach? should they teach that killing people is wrong? how about stealing? should they put things in context, so that stealing is only wrong in a society that recognises personal property. should they conflate morality with law? that opens yet another can of worms.
