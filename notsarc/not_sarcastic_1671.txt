oh really xaeon? netherlands has had prostitution legal for years and they are one of the most primary destinations for humans being trafficked. europe has many countries who have legalized prostitution but suffer from increased human trafficking. but maybe the us is different?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_the_netherlands  with it legalised more people are having sex with whores, and as soon as a whore is infected she doesn't even know it yet, so if she gets infected with hiv she still has sex with customers up until the day her next 'check up' is which is usually once a week. what happens to the infected prostitute? she gets kicked out onto the street. so thats one more woman infected, and possible many more men.
