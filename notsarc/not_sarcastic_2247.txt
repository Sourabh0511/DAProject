have you ever burned a flag? have you ever urinated on a pow flag? i thought you said you never did, so i don't see how i am lambasting you for something you have never done. but do you honestly believe it is ok for any person to urinate on a pow flag just because they think they have a good reason to do it? you said it's their judgment call, right? do you see it as disrespectful or sad like i do?  just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
