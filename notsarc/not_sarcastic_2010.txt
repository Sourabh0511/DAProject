when did mike moore do that? how about in bowling for columbine when he portrayed chuck heston. here is the scene: 1) cut to heston wearing a dark suit. 2) cut to crying children outside columbine high school. 3) cut to heston saying 'from my cold dead hands.' case in point. both portions of the speech were not in dever nor were they about columbine. i got another quote from mike moore. 'fu** the poor' - mike moore. i put that together after a class in the mike moore school of movie editining 101.
