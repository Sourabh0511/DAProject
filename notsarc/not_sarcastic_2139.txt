i think you're missing the point. why would you want to keep people under control? to prevent them from harming other people. the men who created the commandments and the bible i believe had good intentions. they wanted to give people a reason to live their lives well, and the bible was the best and most intelligent thinking of the time (not modern, ancient). it was a good idea, however people started looking past the 'love thy neighbor' stuff and started focusing on unimportant things like homosexuality and abortion. so, my question is why is homosexuality a sin?
