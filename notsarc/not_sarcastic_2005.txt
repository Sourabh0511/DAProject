it's not a state's issue from a gay rights perspective, if the supreme court of the us rules that discrimination of same-sex couples is illegal in marriage, as it did for inter-racial couples. what would this proposed new contract that resembles marriage, be called? we already have such a contract. there's no need to totally re-invent the wheel at this particular time. foundit is correct. it's telling that this issue only comes up when people are looking for a way to not recognize gay couples in marriage.
