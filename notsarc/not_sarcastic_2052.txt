so? anyone can be a victim of sociopaths, no matter what their version of the golden rule. making one vulnerable or not, it's still a 'nicer' form of the ethic. what makes 'social cohesion' is peoples' desire for self-preservation, not compassion for others. that's not the golden rule, it's just the understanding that people are better off if they get along with others. it's sort of like the 'mutually-assured-destruction' doctrine of the cold war.
