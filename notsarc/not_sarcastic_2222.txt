how are they different? both can lead to depression, impaired judgement and decrease in ability. what is the difference? you can't just claim they are completely different and leave it at that. how are they different? you say i fail to provide how sleep [loss] can be just as violent as drugs. you or epaphras_faith have yet to prove that drugs can cause violence. i have just proved that sleep loss causes a decrease in ability and impairs judgement and leads to depression. you haven't proven anything more that drugs does.
