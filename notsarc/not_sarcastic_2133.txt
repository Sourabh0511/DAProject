you choose to distort my post by your suggestion about a 'primitive land': i neither said nor intended to imply as much. try not to let your tendency towards political correctness seek hidden meanings in what are attempts a giving a balanced account of historical events. british imperialism happened: it was not a completely baleful phenomenon. it had some beneficial outcomes even if they were not intended. english happens to be the lingua franca of science, economics, etc. i don't know whether it's uniquely suited to it. do you ? it's obvious that other languages have an input: i'm not making a judgement about them.
