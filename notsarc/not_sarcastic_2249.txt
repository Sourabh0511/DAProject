i don't think much can be inferred about the relationship between guns and crime by comparing the crime rate of a densely populated city with the crime rate of a whole state. virginia has a higher homicide rate that most canadian provinces which is probably a better comparison-  homicide offences, number and rate, by province and territory is it possible to make it much harder for criminals to obtain guns? yes, i think so. if your boat is sinking then you have to plug all the leaks not just some of them. if you keep plugging the leaks then eventually you'll reach a state in which significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns. why do i say this? because significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns in developed countries with stricter and more consistent gun laws. in the us, there is too much inconsistency in gun laws.
