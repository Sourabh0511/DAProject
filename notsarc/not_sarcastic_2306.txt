and as i've already pointed out, this notion that god needs to glorify himself smacks of narcissism on a cosmic scale. why would god in any way need -- or even want -- to demonstrate his glory? he's god: he knows how glorious he is! isn't that enough? and again, as already pointed out, i don't find arbitrary salvation of an undeserving few to be merciful, nor do i find arbitrary damnation of an undeserving many to be just. the calvinist vision of god strikes me as a celestial tyrant.
