well can you point to an instance, either in canada or the united kingdom, where the government mandated firearm registries have been instrumental in solving any number of vicious and felonious crimes? i'm not talking about catching people who let their registration lapse, or those who told their spouses about the location of their gun locker keys, i'm talking about serious crimes like murder and robbery and others. can you provide us with any evidence that would point to how the registries have helped solve any such happenings?
