hello my dear!  what do you think people should live in a peaceful world?  as you know george washington is cruel man who did a lot of bad things in order to be success, to get high position? you know that a lot of people died from washington? most people from iran and irak suffered more distress and you can not imanige that situation. what about the twin towers? maybe you think that that accident was by muslin people? no, it was not! of course washington did it in order to substitute muslim men
