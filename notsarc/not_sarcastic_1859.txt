i'm in total agreement with that statement. unfortunately, parents are passing that mindset on to their children. the us experienced a decline in college enrollment in 2005, which speaks volumes about us lower education and personal motivation, at the very time other nations have accelerated their production of graduates in science and engineering. we'll end up paying a dear economic price for that circumstance.  on the bright side, we have a large surplus of business majors to manage our service industry, the down side being their lack of basic reading and writing skills.
