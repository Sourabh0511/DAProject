as we've seen in recent years, kids who are bullied can become so anti-social that they become violent, and attack those who've bullied them with weapons and mass murders. i'm not condoning this behavior, but i'm not surprised that it happens. those who support the bullying of gay kids and others...well, you get what you sow.
