how did you private insurer determine the coverage in your plan? do they ever make case-by-case determinations not to cover something? i strongly urge you not only to read the house bill and the upcoming senate bill, but also to read your own health insurance plan, in detail, fine print and all, as well as to look into their record of denying claims. it's one of those things that most people don't realize is a problem until it affects them directly, at which point it's too late.
