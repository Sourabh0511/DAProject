this has nothing to do with my post. you don't need to believe in conspiracy theories to believe that the universe is pretty crazy. i'm an advocate of science, and even i admit that, especially at the quantum level, shit gets crazy. particles being in two places at once, 95% of the universe being undetectable, whole separate universes colliding to make new ones. it's crazy yes, but it is also scientific. in fact, compared to science, the answers psychics provide are rather boring. i'm impressed by the stuff i just listed, not some charlatan guessing whether or not i have a dog.
