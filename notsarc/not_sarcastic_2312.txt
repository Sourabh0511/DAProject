did you not say, 'these people need to be stopped?' or was that still part of the article? if that was you, then that is a viewpoint that, if implemented, will directly influence public policy. you say you do not want to make this country a theocracy, right? well, do you want to make it/keep it a non-theocracy? if so, you are trying to extend/keep an ideology imposed through government. i'm not saying that is bad; i am only saying it is what it is.
