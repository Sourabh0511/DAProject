fantasy,fairy tale, wild imagination, adsurd , silly , ridiculous,fabricated .unsupported by one single observation or experiment , unsubstantiated. i do agree we don't speak the same language. no one will explain to me how one steals public information, i am confused. how is work shady? how would you define shady as opposed to rather shady when it refers to work? i thought bookmaking etc. was shady but i am old fashioned i guess. please educate me. is this a meaningfull reprimand coming from someone who believes one can observe a mind? you still have refused to explain that and i was so anxious to hear it. please go on.
