islam is no more built on hate, burder and death than christianity is. do i have to remind you of the inquisition, the holy land wars, the witch burnings, etc.? if you try to claim that what some islamic people have done represents the whole religion, then i can do the same with those things that i listed, only for the christian faith. and don't even get started again on satan being a fallen angel - yes, we know about your beliefs that angels do not have free will, and yet rebelled against god, so we don't need to go into any more of that garbage.
