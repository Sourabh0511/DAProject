falling, did i say that 'the church alone provides for the needy?' if i did please point it out to me. each religion has its own place to turn, but none of them should ever be able to turn to the federal government. the constitution gives certain delegated powers to the federal government and handing money out for educational purposes is not one of them. socialism is merely the stepping stone into communism, and i don't want to see this nation start down that path. maybe i live by the constitution because it is 'the supreme law of the land.' the question is not why do i live by the constitution, but why don't you? until the constitution is replaced it will govern this land, and i plan to live by it.
