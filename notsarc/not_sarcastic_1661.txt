i think so too. every father should have a right to have a say when it comes to an abortion because that fetus was formed from their chromosomes and genetics. i am surprised that advocates for abortion are saying that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they don't have a problem with the decision of the u.s supreme court in which all of the judges were men.
