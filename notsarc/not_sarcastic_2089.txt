Making up numbers again georged? Care to post some links to this data?In 2005 Israel received 2.5 billion, most of it being foreign military financing...there is some more they get though so your 5 billion might be right. As for the 28 billion in 2002...I know that is wrong. I recall a 200 million dollar thing, but I don't know if it went through.The rest of your numbers are probably overstated as well....you have a bad habit of doing so.
