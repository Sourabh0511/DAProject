winston dearie you really shouldn't make such general accusations, that can get you into trouble. point them out if you can. the shooting in norway, columbine, virginia tech, the tulsa shootings and the tuscon assassination attempt weren't carried out by people a normal person could consider decent and respectable in nature and they were all massacres. you might kill somebody too. you might kill a lot of somebodies for no reason. should you be legislated against and restrained?
