fine. thank you.  what im hearing is that you believe attila should act in accordance with the prevailing moral consensus. how do you define the moral consensus? in attilas case, would that be among the huns? among the hun ruling elite? or should attila act in accordance with a wider consensus of which he (for the sake of argument) has no intimate knowledge?  now why should he act in accordance with the consensus?  this is not completely clear to me. so, do you take the position that moral sentiments are learned?
