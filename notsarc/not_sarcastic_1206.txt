I think they have more of a chance becasue, while many manage to delude themselves into believing that an unborn child is not a baby, it would be much more difficult to convince yourself that a crying baby isn't a baby. Even in the animal kingdom (which we are all part of) you see some animals hesitate to kill the young of their own species. Evne coyotes will not generally kill a pup (I have even seen a pack of coyoptes pass a domestic pup without killing it, though they could have. I am told this is because of the stubby nose, which shows the coyotes that it is, indeed, a puppy, even though it looks unfamiliar to them).
