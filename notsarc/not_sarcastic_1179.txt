"again, please explain what possible benefits you forsee with teaching intelligent design. Please show me where it is anything than a belief. Evolution was always considered science. It used the scientific method, and offered evidence for everyone to see and peer review. Until the ""theory"" of intelligent design does that, I will always be forced to put quotes around the word theory, because it will simply be a religious belief."
