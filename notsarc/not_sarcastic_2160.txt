so?? it was still a speech made for the purpose of political support of gay marriage. yes, i watched it. agreed. it was for the purpose of appealing to emotion (to a political end). no, but my point is that neither does the sanitized 'norman rockwell' image that some gay-pride proponents want projected by linking to videos such as the one here. it might give the impression that gay pride is merely some 'family-friendly' movement without the reality of the very dark side to it.
