simple answer? dc has a lot less budget than the usa government. more complex answer? just looking at the commuters, there are over 400,000 people that come to work in dc every day (see link in my last post). making the preposterous assumption that they all come in at a constant flow, just looking at 400,000 of them and assuming that you would only check them coming in, that's ~4.6 people admitted per second for every second of the working week. good luck with that. good luck with convincing people that it's constitutional, as well - airports get away with it, but only because there is such a (largely unfounded) fear of death by terrorist that they can get away with something which is constitutionally shady. a quick search gave me two relevant results almost immediately.
