i guess that you didn't look at my last link. there are recalls every year that effect millions of cars, and those companies are not being bullied by the government. the point is every car company has recalls, and the government is targeting toyota. ford, gm, buick all have recalls. why are they not targeted? so, the government is the almighty paternalistic big brother punishing those bad and irresponsible companies who only care about themselves and wreck endless destruction to society and the environment. no, toyota is committed to fixing faulty accelerator only because of accusations for causing accidents.
