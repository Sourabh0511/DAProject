lol, what did you mean by that? i'm not sure, and dont want to assume the tone you infer with. i thought it was funny but wanted to clarify. ps; i have never called anyone a 'fetus worshiper', although at least that label does not elicit the same evil connotations 'pr-abortion does'. @ simone, no worries hun :)
