dear, as i have already said that rape is committed by persons of imbalance minds/or intoxicated persons. so, logically they can't exercise self control (and that's y we call them mentally imbalanced). i agree , that if a woman says no, it means no. but , in that state of mind a man can't understand that she is denying, what a rapist thinks is only his sexual gratification. and that's y its a crime . and we have punishments for it.. thank you for ur time. and i appreciate ur views..
