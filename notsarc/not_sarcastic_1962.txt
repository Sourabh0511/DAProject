[quote=jo bennett;314232]stabbing yourself is not ok, but that doesn't mean it should be illegal. i'm not even going to bother with your non-sequitor, but i imagine plenty of alcohol manufacturers enjoy the occasional drink. these are mostly caused by illegal guns. you can't outlaw something thats already illegal. i highly doubt this. how can a gun be illegal when it used to be legal? most illegal guns are bought off the black market.
