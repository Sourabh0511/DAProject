"But what about the hypothetical?I can't think of a single child on this planet that has never been exposed to the ideas of the supernatural.So, what I was asking is whether faith is nature or nurture.That's why I brought up kids being afraid of the dark, likely no matter what anyone tells them. I think it's this fear of the unknown linked to the ""logical"" brain of a human that possibly creates this need for explanations. But faith involves specifics, so when the specifics are filled in and ""make sense"" to more than one person, these specific ""explanations"" can be passed down.So I don't know how much of faith is nature and how much is nurture."
