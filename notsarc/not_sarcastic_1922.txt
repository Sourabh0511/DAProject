'would the french accept people singing the la marseillaise in english as a sign of french patriotism? of course not,' there are so many flaws in this comparison it is unbelievable. firstly, there are virtually no french citizens for whom english is their first language. second, english isn't the national language of the us, nor is it a language that evolved there. a better comparison would be la marseillaise translated into bretagne, or translating 'oh canada' into french.
