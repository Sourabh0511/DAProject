it did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered. nobody knew the mechanism till that era. and of course hgt is just another form of variability to be taken into account. genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. why do you think otherwise? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.
