are you saying you only have a hard time having compassion for the gay victims of sexually transmitted illness? if, so that just shows your anti-gay prejudice. what difference does that make? everyone who has aids is a victim. in some communities and in other countries, the majority who have it are straight. against the victims from the largest social group of victims in each jurisdiction? this is nothing more than prejudice and destructive political agenda.  i would hope there are other, better, human instincts inside of you.
