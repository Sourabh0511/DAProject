"First of all, it's not a precedent. this is the seventh or eighth state where a higher court has found anti-gay discrimination in marriage unconstitutional. Secondly, when so many rulings go in this direction, it can hardly be called ""lawlessness"". It's a call for lawful, constitutional interpretation of statutes.It takes extraordinary intellectual dishonesty to pretend there is some ""agenda"" at work. These decisions are the consequence of two things: our long history of rationally applying those silly words about equality that folks smarter than this generation of politicians put in the Constitution AND a long-term correction of the misunderstandings of what homosexuality IS and what its consequences are.I know you don't personally believe it, but there is nothing wrong with us."
