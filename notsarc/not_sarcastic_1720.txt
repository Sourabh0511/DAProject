that's not because of something i did. that's because of something that happened back in the 1950s, i believe. that's fine--go ahead and be offensive! it will only hamper your efforts because it only makes people angry at you when you belittle things they hold dear. but what about religious people that aren't out to do that to you and your family? if the govt. endorses a religion, remove the endorsement! that's fine. you're still willing to be offensive to all religious people because of fundamentalists (which are really the ones doing what you describe!). you can be as offensive and show as much lack of respect as you want. it's only going to make it harder on you to convince people.
