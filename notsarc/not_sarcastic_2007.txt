what extended family interference? even mass same-sex marriages can't get ss benefits. you should research joint tenants in common becasue that isn't true that isn't a gaornment decision. that is a business decision. businesses can decide to allow it if they want to, so marriage wouldn't change that. i'm saying what can't you do without it. not about marriages in mass. also the federal government wouldn't recognize it anyways because of defense of marriage act. so far you haven't named one yet. also as couples you don't have that right but individually you have the rights as any citizen.  calling me full of **** while i just showed you have you're wrong.. funny.
