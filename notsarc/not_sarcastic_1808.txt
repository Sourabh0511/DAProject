i'm a little surprised by this. the polls i've seen show that mass voters favor gay marriage. i would have thought that getting those who oppose it to put their opposition on the record before the elections would be beneficial. then again, seeing as how the lies and fear mongering have already started, i can see how they might want to avoid having the elections muddied with the inevitable dirty fighting that would be thrown at them. not the most couragous stance, but perhaps safer in the long run. you are right that the longer society fails to collapse the more inane the doomsayers seem.
