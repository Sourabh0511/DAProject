"Actually, everything the bible say's belies your ""atheist answer"". The reality is that the world itself and all of Gods Creation speaks to His existence as being self evident. It takes a degree of faith to accept Jesus as our personal Savior, but as far as accepting the reality of God Himself, all one need do is look observe the world we live in to see that only an incredible and loving God could create such a Beautiful and marvelous World with so many amazing symbiotic and perfectly interdependent forms of life."
