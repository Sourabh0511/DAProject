pro-choice is a sexist concept. it only applies to women. pro-choice doesn't give you much of a choice. it sounds like what you're saying is that anything that has to do with only one gender, is sexist. if not, please clarify.  pro choice does give you a choice. you can either continue the pregnancy, or seek an abortion.  the pro life argument eliminates abortion and mandates that you continue the pregnancy (barring rape, etc).  if you're joking, then ignore this.
