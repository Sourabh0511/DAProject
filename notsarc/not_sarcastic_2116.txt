"Maybe you are having trouble with the concept of ""low premium, high deductible"". That means the monthly payments (premiums) are low, and the deductible is higher (cost you actually pay for services). This shouldn't be a problem. How often do you actually use your health insurance? I use mine very rarely (not at all in the last year). It appears that what Bush is trying to do is get insurance coverage to low income folks without a multi trillion dollar price tag (like kerrys plan carries). This isn't a bad thing, and I am not even a bush supporter."
