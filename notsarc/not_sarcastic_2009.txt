yet everything in that site is cited with sources such as cnn and what not. i understnad the florida right to life is not credible to our discussion(as they are not neutral) however the things they cite are...and that is what you should look at. so murder is a subjective term now...i laugh at that. your point was what again? they fact that vor didn't prove his case and never does? i don't understand....however, maybe if you looked at the sources on that site you would see that it is in the upper 90%s (however this is clinical abortions...not underground ones).
