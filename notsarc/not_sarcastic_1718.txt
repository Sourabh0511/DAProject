oh really?  science does not say 'we dont know x, y, z, but we want to know x, y, z, and so we observe x, y, z, and come up with our conclusions and claim it to be true, or not? (it's a question..) if scientists were too busy learning what is, then the science that is present now, would be non existent, because in order for science to learn and understand, it must be too busy learning and understanding what 'might be', or what it has not known, yet.
