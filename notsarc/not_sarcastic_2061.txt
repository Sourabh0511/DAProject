i asked on another thread, but it fits here as well... is there a distinction between the absence of belief in x and the belief in the absence of x? before, i suggested that i couldn't see a distinction, but after pondering it for awhile, i believe there is a distinction between the two: if one asserts that there is no god (or gods), this is a belief in the absence of god. if one makes no assertions one way or another (even internally), then this would be an absence of belief. i'm not certain into which 'side' atheism would fall, though i believe it would have to be the former, and therefore, a belief. the latter sounds more like agnosticism to me. but perhaps someone else can better clarify this topic.
