so do you think before you speak? abraham left mesopotamia, modern day iraq, for canaan to start a new religion. so where did he start the religion? canaan, modern day israel.  and yes i know that there is much more to the bible and my point was that you can't believe the bible 100 percent world for world or you would be contradicting yourself.
