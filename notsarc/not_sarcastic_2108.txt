Why do conservatives support conservatives? Paul's theology found favor with the Christians that won amongst the early churches. Paul was not considered an Apostle by the original 11 and Barnabas. Luke doesn't have him meet a risen Jesus only Paul says he did. His first missionary trek was a failure and the next two he was not equal with Barnabas.But the Apostles did not teach the same as Paul, similiar but not the same.
