truth can be found in god. we as humans have a relative idea of what truth is because everyone will not agree on what is truth and what is not. for instance, one might say that europe will regain world power or that america will remain the world power but if everyone doesn't believe it how true is it? but universal truth can be considered aboslute such as math. 1 + 1 is 2, 12 inches equal a foot, etc. the question will remain to be unanswered until god reveals what truth is.
