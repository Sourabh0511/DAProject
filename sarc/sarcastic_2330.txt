"And you're mentally disturbed. Didn't I say that there is no such thing as a ""ex-gay""??? Did I stutter?You can pretend that denial is a river over in Egypt. Somebody thinking that they can successfully ""supress"" their true orientation, and deny themselves homosexual contact, is delusional..because the truth will always come out..because that's what the truth does. Show me an ex-gay, and I'll show you a liar. Where are they, that I can query them? I'll wait."
