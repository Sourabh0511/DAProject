i'll agree with you on some of the things you said, but not the hired gun. america doesn't need to hire guns, we have our own. if what you are asserting is the case, then why would we be where we are right now. and are you saying that israel gets there weapons for free? this is america son, nothing is free if you haven't found out. and our strong ties with israel are more than likely due to the fact that they're more trustworthy than any of the arab nations, thus making a greater ally.
