i do like written constitutions very much; and our constitution is not vague at all. in the first amendment, the question is not whether congress may make a law, but rather what is 'the freedom of the press?' this phrase has objective, historic meaning, and obscenity is not covered within that objective, historic meaning. neither, by the way, is the publishing of nuclear secrets. you have gathered incorrectly, for i do not want a direct democracy. how do you suppose we got 'civil rights' recognized in the constitution to begin with, matthew? did the words just magically appear there, or did a vast majority of people vote to put them there? oh yes, that's right, a vast majority of people voted to put them there. darn evil democracy! i say down with majority rule!
