that i later 'concede' in a pm? you mean despite the fact that probably coming up on a dozen times now i have told you premises represent evidence and you decided that the last time i told you this was a concession.... what do you think a 'logical premise' is? show me denying that i said a. i'll be honest i have no way to prove otherwise because proof relies on logic. of course there is an objective truth here, i can illustrate the contradiction inherent in false logic using the real world; but if you don't accept that contradiction is unacceptable....
