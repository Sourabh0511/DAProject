wow, that's a huge blanket statement which you haven't bothered to qualify. guess that means it's just a personal attack because you had no better argument, huh?  just because someone does not like what society has become does not necessarily mean one hates the concept of structural society. unfortunately you haven't qualified either concept in your ad hominem attack of jake.
