Ah, so I don't like democracy, and yet it is you who in the post are telling me that I have to support McCain's statement. Are you serious? That sure doesn't sound like democracy to me. I also find it funny that you claim that I don't like democracy when my very post stated that I would be voting for the Democrat party. But then, I guess if we don't support Bushyboy and his fellow republicanazis, we must be against democracy, right? Get real, Phyllis.
