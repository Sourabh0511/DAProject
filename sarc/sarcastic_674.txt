The judge should be informed that 'the leading' IDist admits that ID is religion. (yes, I've posted this before...) What else could an unembodied designer, which naturalism perforce excludes, be but a deity? So Dembski's ID has one or more unspecified deities - supernatural, unembodied designers - creating biological systems, at some unknown time, at some unknown place, by some unknown series of steps. What a great scientific theory! :-)
