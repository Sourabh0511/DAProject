which post do you think most accurately demonstrates archie's ethics? is it the one(s) where he denigrates gays? the one(s) where he accuses those who disagree with him of being filthy, rotten liars, but is incapable of providing an example of their dishonesty? maybe it's the one(s) where he goes off on an insult laden rant that manages to break damn near every point of the tos? since i've just listed pretty much all of his posts, which one demonstrates archie's impeccable ethics the best? seeing as how you just accused a perfect stranger of having no ethics, simply because he disagreed with you, i'm not surprised you feel a kinship with archie.
