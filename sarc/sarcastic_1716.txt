anyone else see the irony? i don't have time to look up my facts, but i'll just say my opinions are facts!  let's just ignore that overall, republican adminstrations have more officials indicted or convicted of state & federal laws. nixon's adminstration alone accounts for many of the republican number (golwater called nixon the most dishonest person he'd ever met in his life). and do we need to remind jim of the ratio of republicans who have gone to jail or been indicted compared to democrats in the past 6 years?  right. strom thurmand laughs at you from his grave.  with a ideology like that, i'm not surprised.
