oh hank, you really are funny. the way you are changing. i simply made a statement that it was one of many posts that you have agreed on. that was the post you disputed. are you still near all those paint-fumes? it must be the rotational affect of the egg-shaped world you live on! :) as i said... how simple is that? it is one that you've agreed on, and you now agree that it's one of several that you've agreed on. what is your point?  i made a statement that you now agree on. you raised an objection, you even say that everyone knows what you said, excepting me. how have i demonstrated i don't understand you? i haven't disputed your original statement. i made a complimentary statement.
