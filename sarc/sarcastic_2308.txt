emoticonXFrazzledTalk about a fast and loose accusation.WHAT DID HE ACTUALLY SAY???Cause Harry Hay is well known for his gay rights work.If Jennings did find something about the guy inspiring, it was probably his gay rights work.If I said that I thought Martin Luther King Jr was inspiring, would you automatically associate my praise with extramarital affairs?This is just stupid!
