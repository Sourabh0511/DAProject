no.. go read the bible before you look dumber than you already do. sorry dear, ad hominems do nothing. it sounds like you're talking about something you know little about. i apologize i sound that way. i certainly know what i am referring to in the bible, and knowing that you have admitted you don't necessarily follow the whole bible (god > bible) i figured i wouldn't assume you believed in genesis adam and eve. but rather give you the option to say yes or no.  god didn't want us to be puppets.  i didn't necessarily say puppets. he wanted us to have free will, to do what we wanted -and if they did love him, it should be their choice. if sin wasn't created, we would have been god's puppets. so god was performing some twisted reverse psychology on adam and eve?
