poet i found it interesting your illutration of the 'matirx' series. i too have seen the two episodes and found it filled with religious overtones. i dont know the faith of the wachaski brothers but there story is intreging. all mankind decived by this lifstyle which as seen from reality is merely a save to produce power. much like mankind is decived by satan today. a select group of people who believe that a savior wil come to free man kind from this savery. even those who have seen the truth and reject it. this sounds alot like the account of the bible. i want so much to see the final episode to find if the theme continues. will neo's death be that which saves all mankind? we will wait and see.
