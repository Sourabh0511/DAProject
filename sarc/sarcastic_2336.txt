wrong again!! .. as was just politely pointed out to me a minuet ago it's about ' what does termination stop ' and my answer adresses this. it's a valid point .. focus on the life here first befor allowing more unwanted life to be come a part of the system.  have you adopted an unwanted child yet? if not i would submit you should focus you anti abortion energy on those kids first.
