i have several that i want everyone who engages in the 'man caused global warming' debate to consider.... and i thank you for helping to illustrate some of those points for me (bold text above). asside from the points we've already discussed,... i am a bit intrigued by the fact that many of your ilk (concerned about saving the lives of millions by reversing or slowing the warming trends of the planet) are seemingly oblivious and uncaring about the millions who are deliberately killed in the name of 'choice.' isn't the decision to drive an suv a choice as well? emoticonxrolleyes
