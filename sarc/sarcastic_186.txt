Yep, so much for a pastor knowing his sheep(le).  It's no wonder that they aren't noticed when they go missing.  What ever happened for the shepherd going out and seeking his lost sheep to bring them back to the fold???  As to this case.  I mentioned earlier about Rick Warren (author of A Purpose Driven Life)...he doesn't have armed guards in his mega church.  But, then again, he's not a fleecing WofF in shepherds clothing who seeks to ravenously devour a flock.
