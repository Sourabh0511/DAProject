well, it's nice to know my assumption there was a dishonest ulterior motive (rather than actually wanting to discuss it) to the request was indeed correct. can't say i'm surprised though. this poster has consistently avoided actual discourse with most anyone with whom he'd find real disagreement (gasp!) for as long as i've known of him, usually choosing instead to throw his easy 'drive-by' insults from the peanut gallery. basically, he's a coward, and most anywhere else would probably be considered a troll.
