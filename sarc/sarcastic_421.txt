In other words you would wait until we were attacked again before doing what is required. If we vacillate and wait for the nuclear cloud it will be too late. It amazes me; utterly amazes me, at how strongly felt the left believes in the good will of bin Laden and the terrorists to clean up their act. Just amazing. But with Bush? Noooooooo. He's ALWAYS wrong and never right. Isn't that about it?
