i don't want or not want to call this 'frame of refference' *thing* anything i'm just trying to work out what you consider it is. tell me what it is. tell me what it's capabilities are. if it is abstract in nature what is it's actual worth as a concept. whatever that is... this *something*? you aren't your body as i've shown but because your body generates your mind it, that which affects the body can effect the mind which i can only imagine is part of this 'frame of refference' *thing*. or, in reality, 'i', 'you' and 'me' is an illusion and doesn't actually exist.
