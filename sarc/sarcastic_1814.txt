fine lets just all be on our own, fuck government, fuck state, fuck town, fuck family, lets all do what we feel so long as it makes us happy. there has to be an order to things if not there will be chaos, history has proven this time and time again, but if you think that's the way to live be my guest, you will not live to long, the universe seeks balance and order not chaos. yes power will corrupt this is the reason for the system we have, like family, town, state, government and un to prevent the power hungry from taking over, it is up to us to prevent that from happening, we the people are the world not some lone wolf.
