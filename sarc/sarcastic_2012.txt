ok to lie?? no. having people preaching 'the evolution of species from a cell to every living creature and plant life on earth', and tell me 'its darwin's origin of species, you should try reading it sometime', after i had just presented them an entire paragraph from hitler's meine kempf - entertaining! having your beloved talkorigins crew flunk the test straight-up as they were asked, 'who said the following, _________, hitler or darwin?', while going a whopping 0-3 for a revealing score of zero............ ...............priceless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
