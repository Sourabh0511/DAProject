you kind of made a good point here... both the government and the church have ulterrior motives for 'helping the poor': the politicians hope to gain votes and the church hopes to gain converts...both groups of suckers will be paying back for the rest of their lives in one way or another.  and the church collects more of 'it's own money' to purchase more poor sinners. both groups are indentured servants to their masters. what do you mean 'generous with your own money'? isn't that what the government is? perhaps the christians don't want to help all the poor - only those who belong to their church or those willing to sell their souls to it. both are doing a terrible job of 'helping the poor'.
