"Kinda like, ""Don't speak of the speck in your brothers eye when you have a plank in your own?"" :p :p   The scary part of this insane reality is that there are a LOT of whackos that think just like and actually support Pat Robertson. And I would venture to say that 98% of them who voted, voted for Bush. Ha! There's one born every minute.   Perhaps this might clue some folks in, as to the concerns the folks have on the left, as to the direction this nation is headed? Or, then again, maybe not. emoticonXRolleyes"
