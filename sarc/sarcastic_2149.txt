why would you think such an absurd concept. corporations don't cast a vote in an election do they? why not?  does a corporation have a mind of it's own that it may look to it's interests in it's attempts to influence legislation? no, it permits individuals to overcome finance laws and exercise greater influence than is normally permitted for an individual. should your car have rights? you pay a tax for it. how about your house? pay a tax for that also every year.
