Man cannot invent anything that did not already exist in form. Did we invent the wheel, or discover the idea? Did the Wright brothers invent machine powered flight, or was it that they stumbled upon it? In every culture, in every society, man looks to something greater than himself. They simple don't leave it at themselves and be done with it.
