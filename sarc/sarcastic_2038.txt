'we the people of the united states, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence,[1] promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america.' there you go, easy and archy. that's the only part that matters when it comes to the purpose for the founding of this country. notice that it it based on the authority of 'we the people'. it doesn't say, 'in the name of jesus.' perhaps you either of you can tell me how many times god is mentioned? how many times is jesus mentioned? how many times is religion mentioned? you failed at the first test. can you do better at the second?
