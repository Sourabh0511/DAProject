Dear smiling, friendly, forgiving Archangel:  I would be quite happy to respond to you if you could organize your incoherent mental states into logical, debatable points. Please refer to Chester's Questions for Bible-thumpers for guidelines.  As for staying on topic: since there is no God, it is rather pointless to have religious ceremonies in any case, isn't it?  As for my nom de Web, you have missed the point altogether. Either you are not quick on the uptake and/or you are completely ignorant of the Japanese language. Hint: surely you have seen the starry emblem on all Subaru cars?  To end on a conciliatory note: I entirely agree with the last sentence of your posting [except the punctuation].  -
