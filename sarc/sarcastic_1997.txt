really? is the aaas a non-scientific organization too? hope you don't read the journal science because it isn't good enough for you.  you just choose to attack the source because it disagrees with your viewpoint. don't let science get in the way of your fanatic beliefs. emoticonxgood  if it isn't a peer-reviewed journal than why does it have to be reviewed by two experts in the field? why is the journal associated with the aaas? why do you attack the source and not offer one that supports your view? is it because you can't provide evidence for any claim you make or because you enjoy the taste of sand? keep digging that hole dane.
