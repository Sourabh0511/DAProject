every single time you make the assisinine statement 'the baby isn't the woman's body' you downplay the part the woman's body plays. maybe it isn't the body - but it can't live without the woman's body. the owner of said body should be making decisions for said body.  when you are willing to force pregnancy against the will and without the voice of the woman who is pregnant - you are hi-jacking her body. i forget - are you one of those force the rape victim to carry the baby lifers? pretty close and i will fight you hard if you try trample one inch of it.  i still don't give a damn what they may or may have not have thought about abortion, nor was that an argument i was trying to make.
