You mus think you're pretty smart huh? Well guess what? You're confusing common, most common, majority, and norm. Lefthandedness is considerd common and the norm. You're using a superstistion from 300 years ago to qualify left handedness as deviant. Good try though.  Also left handed is genetic. It's not a gene but it's genetically related to the person's physical characteristics.
