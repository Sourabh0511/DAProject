so much bs... where should i start? eugenics is about manipulating genomes of populations. since when are most abortions performed for the purpose of lowering or raising the frequency of certain alleles or traits in populations? if a woman wants to maximize her life, liberty, and happiness, and she feels that she can best do so by aborting a pregnancy, your intended prevention of that action 'flies in the face of the declaration of independence'... (not that the declaration has any legal standing.) whether an embryo or fetus is human is irrelevant. no thing, human or not, has the right to subsist completely on a human without the latter's consent. 'abortive technologies'? you sound like falwell, insisting that cloning destroys life when it does nothing of the sort. please explain your laughable statement.
