you mean pascals sucker bet? if arch is wrong, he's wasted a good portion of his life and income catering to a false priesthood, a tick suckling off the fat and meat and marrow of their 'flocks'. he's prevented himself from exploring the wonderful opprotunities this limited life has to offer for the nebulous promises that come after death is assured.  furthermore, he's extolling others to do so also. because misery needs company to justify itself and in insecurity over the rediculous beliefs they hold, they need numbers to validate their wastes and servitude.
