i'm back!! had to re-visit the real world. anyway, how is it that you say i'm confused about my sexuality, because i don't approve of gay marriage?! that is weak! people always claim things like that when they have nothing else to say. i'm straight as hell, and you really don't know me engough to say diffrently. but you on the other hand must be confused.
