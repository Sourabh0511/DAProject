i would ask you for a link, but this time i'm not feeling generous.  didn't you know that there are about 2.5 million cases of gun self defence annually, in about 92% of those cases nobody was harmed? does this even compare to the microscopic 102,200 deaths (don't tell me that's, wrong thats the very number that your cult has been using, comrade) that the brady fanatics have been whining about? your stats are simply untrue.
