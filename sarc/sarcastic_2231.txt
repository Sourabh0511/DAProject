another question that shouild be answered is . . . if the bible says that noah and a few members of his family were the only ones to survive this 'global' flood, how come there are so many other accounts of others surviving a flood? did god miss the target (that being the whole of humanity)? genesis 6:13 (new international version) 13 so god said to noah, 'i am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. i am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. presumably he also knew from the beginning of time that he was going to make this great big ####-up. how embarrassing!
