a: when it comes to civil rights, the'majority' does not rule!!!!!!!!!!! i suggest you 'float your boat' in the direction of the vatican city, as you have already proven that your first allegiance is to there, not to the usa of which you presume to be a citizen. emoticonxrolleyes  so what would you have us do? stand by silently while you promote the dogma of a sovereign foreign power (vatican city) to control the rights of us citizens? with your bigoted attitude, i am totally surprised yu are not advocating a constitutional ammendment to make the rcc the one, only, and required legal religion in the usa with the pope as chief executive. emoticonxrolleyes emoticonxrolleyes
