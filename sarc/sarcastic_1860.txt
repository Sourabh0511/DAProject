what is not only illogical but patently false is the assertion that the unborn baby is making his mother a slave of any kind. did that baby force her to conceive it? is that baby the equivalent of a tumor as the pro abortionists claim them to be? no, it is an unborn human being who just needs the time to grow and develop in order to be a sentient being just as we are as we type on these keyboards.  that explains everything about how irrational you are! but based on your posts though, i think they already pulled the plug. emoticonxfrazzledemoticonxdonno
