i would agree with you, but first of all, the owner of the show has every right to not allow cameras. second, it would be a huge invasion of privacy if all women knew what their ex wives could keep spying on what they buy and what they do. they have no buisness doing that. very funny, but just because men don't want their rights violated by nosy ex wives and their lawyers and pis, does not mean that they love their guns any more than they do women. its simply a hobby. men don't insist on following women around, watching everything they buy and everything they do, do they? men are entitled to guns just as women are entitled to manicures. our rights are going out the window fast.
