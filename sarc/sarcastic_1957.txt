really? i never miss the chance to tell everyone that i'm going to heaven? i challenge you to quote me ever bragging that i'm going to heaven and you're not. what i have done is promised you mockers and scoffers that the day will come when you will learn the truth about how wrong you are to reject the living god. but never have i boasted that i am going to heaven while you're not. and never has my motivation for promising you that you will ultimately learn the truth been to make such a point. so quote my posts kronus. prove me wrong and defend your lying claim. and i want links to posts in context to the debate and point being made at the time.
