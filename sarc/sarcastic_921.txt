BOY-HOWDY!! Why don't you let me know how you really feel? I have not tried to demonize anything. Rap music does that to itself without any help from me. Rap is the lowest form of music that I have ever heard. It is just too primative for my tastes. Once again, I am not a racist, nor am I sexist. I do my own washing. I wish you and your child nothing but the best in life. Some folks think that exposing young children to Rap music is a form of child abuse, I agree with those folks.  P.S. Tell that Southern girl to find another room-mate, you sound like a horrible role model. Well, got to go wash some more underwear.
