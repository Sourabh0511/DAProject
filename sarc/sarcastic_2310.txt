what about all of the school killings that have involved use of revolvers, shotguns, and ieds? what's your p***ing away excuse for instances like these? in reality school shootings are linked to them being target rich environments where nobody can mount any opposition to the deranged killer. it's like a wolf in the chicken coop.
