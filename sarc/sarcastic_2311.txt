absolute nonsense. nope, not at all. go read the relevant paper again. utter garbage. 'fittness'(sic), however you are defining that notion today, is a function of the relation of an organism with/to its own environment, but 'complexity', as any engineer or dictionary will tell you, is an intrinsic trait of whatever system has it; external environment be damned. so do you have a measure of complexity for a genome without reference to the external environment? really? what is that measure? you're entitled to your groundless opinion on anything, including parasites. yes i am, and i ought to be. i earned the right by doing original research on the topic of host-parasite relations as exlempified by chemical communications between them. did rather nice work at that. the core paper is still cited rather often even after 30 years.
