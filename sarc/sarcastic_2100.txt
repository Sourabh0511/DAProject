boy $346,000? i can think of a few $300,000 firearms in existance today. if anyone of them every shot and killed a person, boy it would be sooooo easy to trace it down. so then why bother banning them? using a $300,000 gun to shoot someone is like hit and run in a bright red ferrari in a busy intersection, the cops are going to find you.
