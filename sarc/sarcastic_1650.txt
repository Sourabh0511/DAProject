oh yeah you're right! i suppose only sane americans get guns! no wonder 0% of the population are killed in gun warfare. oh wait, a considerable amount of people are killed by guns. silly me! of course all the sane people can also shoot who they want in some states, just because they feel threatened by it. sure keep guns, advocate them why don't you. after all, all those people killed, and the families of those people.. hasn't happened to you, so why should you care?!?!
