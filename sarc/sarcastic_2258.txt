Spanking doesn't teach children to defend themselves against violence. It teaches them the exact opposite because they are forced to submit to these acts of violence *and* they are told it's being done out of love. Do you ever wonder what conditions some women and men to accept violence from their partner? Do you ever wonder how they could not recognize it as abuse? I'll give you three guesses. Different personalites process and categorize information in different ways. Unfortunately for many children, this is one of them. :( And unfortunately I'm speaking from experience.
