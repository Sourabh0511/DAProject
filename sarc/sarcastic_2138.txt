and jyoshu is in full cheer-leader mode... what the heck did i supposedly back-peddle on? please. be explicit. no wait. you're not going to answer that, are you... roflmao! symbiote runs around proclaiming all sorts of things (falsely) as my supposed hypothesis, and you pretend that me refusing to take up her strawman approach is somehow 'back-peddling'? more like the blind leading the blind, walking in circles and thinking they are travelling quickly! as for proof, do you understand what 'hypothesis' means in the first place? look it up.
