"How do you know it is him? It's a simple question. IF he is writing as Lurch, and someone else comes onto a board, as Ungerdunn, who is just as rude (which is what you are saying), you assume it's the same person? Or, is it because they both claim to be biologists? I guess that having another person enter a forum, and claim to be a biologist would narrow it down to just the same person emoticonXClown All you've done is said you know it is him because one writer is as rude as the other... and that this gives his identity away by some mysterious process, probably I don't understand this as I've never read set-theory! emoticonXWow What should be a very easy question becomes you repeating ""I know it is him"".Also, has he been banned as Lurch on these other fora?"
