whoa! duo. give the kid a chance. it seems that you are skeptical that he can offer empirical 'proof' that his god exists. certainly, since he is a 'philosophy and theology' major he must understand the implications of 'proof' in the context of science, as well as the meaning of the term 'empirical'. after all, wouldn't those ideas be something that a philosopher would be expected to understand? so let's await his 'empirical proof' without laughter. wait until he presents his 'empirical proof' before we laugh.
