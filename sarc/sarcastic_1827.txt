that wasn't a reason why we fought hitler. in fact, if you will remember many in the states didn't believe that occured until they saw the pictures.  hardly a reason to invade. unless you'd like to flip it around and say that every country who's leader we tried to murder has the same right. emoticonxrolleyes  how is that our problem? oh yes, it's not.  as i recall, we kicked him out, beat him up, put him under sanctions and virtually removed any ability to do anything of revelance.  doesn't that mean we have to invade north korea? emoticonxrolleyes  that's been dealt with already. rehashed arguments are worthless.  huh. stalinist govermemnt. reminds me of the dictators the us put in power in latin america. :) the mass graves also was dealt with. but then again, you clearly do not understand the me culture.
