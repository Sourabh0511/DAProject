she was never 'pro-gun' to you people. she was an anti. omg they reported on something. not exactly ready to help her reputation out before she was shot, though, were they? you have lots of bros that are lunatics. and one of them just shot and murdered 6 people, including a federal judge who was sitting on an immigration case and a congresswoman who opposed to arizona's immigration law. arizona: your land of cowgirl jan and cowboy sheriff joe.  i never heard of anyone who truly understood what a soul was, who thought they didn't need a mirror. i'm not surprised you think yourself at the level of god himself, able to judge who has a soul and who doesn't. it's the same psychology your bro with a gun just demonstrated.
