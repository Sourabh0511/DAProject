Why is it that people don't want to admit that it was Bush's' reckless spending on a War that we didn't need , the tax cuts for the richest 2 % of America, The Fact that under Bush they had to ADD space on the Debt clock, not to mention that he was as dumb as a rock, yet they can place all this blame on Obama who inherited this mess and has done more to get us out of it than Bush or any Republican would have done. Unemployment is High, we know this, but it was on it's way up when Obama took over because under Bush more corporations left this country , more businesses closed down, the Banks were allowed to do whatever they wanted without regulation of any kind, and yet none of it is his fault?.. Enlighten me...
