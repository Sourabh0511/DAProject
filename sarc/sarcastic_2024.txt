are you retarded or just ignorant? either way, get your facts right. limbaugh and savage do not have tv shows so if they want to listen to beck they still can on the radio. second, you imply fox fired beck...umm, no. third, the glenn beck program was the third most watched cable news program between two other fox news programs.  i'm not a fan of the glenn beck tv program but at least i'm not going around making stuff up.
