how are you proving that when you have gone out of your way to ignore your failures?  tell me, does comic book art prove creationism? does tv props prove creationism? is oil a hydrocarbon? is density sorting in a fluid medium 'ludicrous?' does a theory that requires miracles work on a scientific level?  how is 'why' the same as 'what?' and since when does grammar depend on the person saying it rather than the statement being said? you claimed that taz did not screw up the grammar, yet i did. yet the statements were identical. how are you addressing what i said when you've completely ignored everything i listed?  more yelling. no actual argument.  the whole point of that was to show you make large numbers of asinine statements. do you reject that?  red bold statements don't make a winning argument.
