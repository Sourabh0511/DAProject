so was dominating and enslaving of women. doesn't mean we should do it just because it has historicity.  actually i've heard this idea by numerous people, on both sides of the issue. i can see the merits myself--give couples' benefits in a way that doesn't utilize a cultural and religious institution that has nothing to do with legality to begin with. that way at least cultural marriage doesn't have to be redefined to any extent and legal benefits would no longer be any sort of reflection of any one group's cultural and ideological views.  by the way, what do you mean by 'anti-gay' in your phrase 'anti-gay people'? that's always important to nail down.
