of course it crossed my mind, but logic isn't allowed; this is religion. jesus isn't showing up or walking away from their bread munching wine drinking rituals. i am supposed to be surprised that jesus supposedly said just one more thing which makes no sense what so ever? the early church wasn't called catholic because there were no other protestants running around to differentiate between. if imagination alone could generate heaven, you would be right. i have no reason to believe heaven exists. which are based on the beliefs of the early church, which you have already admitted existed during jesus's life time.
