show me the post where i want a theocracy or eat it.  back at you.  god creates life in a mothers womb (psalm 139:13, etc.).  you can't stand the truths in the bible, can you? you have to hem and haw and do a barack obama and try to spin it away. it's not working for you, pappi. jesus is the resurrected savior and god creates life. and you can't stand the truth.
