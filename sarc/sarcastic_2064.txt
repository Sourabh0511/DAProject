so you are saying that this country is based on principles of judaism? that is a date, dummy. it is not a founding principle. it was how dates were done. and 'our lord' could have been mohamed for all you know, except that it was the standard for dates. no christian principles. so at least you admit that you can't give a single location and that you can't even tell me how many times god, jesus, and religion are mentioned.
