i find it funny you think article v was repealed yet the bill of rights references article v for passage.  so we have the bill of rights which can't be repealed but article v which was repealed meaning all the amendments we had are unconstitutional? you've really lost it haven't you. what do you mean 'sos' by the way? save our ship haha? i have been saving your ship.
