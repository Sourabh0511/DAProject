well, then why are the doctors trying 2 also test the embyonic cells? what's their reason then? we don't know, because the doctors might not want everything that they're doing be on the front page of every newspaper. they have their reasons for their actions, and they just don't want people like you to know about them. or...they already have their reasons published and everything and you're just 2 close-minded 2 take the information in.
