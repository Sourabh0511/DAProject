Hey, Jack, in case it missed your expert scrutiny, I'm first normally responding to some pro-gay argument that's referenced in a great many of those posts. There's scores of you guys defending such iniquity at any given time. Just look at the last twenty posts and it's five or more of you pro-gay pundits vs. one or two respondents. Seems to me it your cause to promote and defend, just like we're seeing across America. Make you guys a deal: You shut up about it and it will greatly please me to never mention it. I don't suppose you will ever do that now, will you? LOL!
