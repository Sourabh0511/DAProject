two reasons: first, i come from a jewish family, and i've never heard of this before. now, i'll grant that nothing says that i should have, but this is news to me. second, and more importantly, trebor is not the person who made the positive claim; you are. it is your burden of proof. no one here can blame me for questioning your bare assertions given your history with falsehoods. so if he doesn't respond in a mere three hours, you declare victory? how about you call me presumptuous again? emoticonxrolleyes for once you acknowledge that you aren't able to back up your claim. congratulations. try it next time without accusing somebody of being cowardly and misleading.
