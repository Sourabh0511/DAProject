So if I go out and buy a Brand X car and then regret it a year later, does that mean that nobody should be allowed to go out and buy a Brand X car? Am I entitled to have an opinion and share it with others...sure. However, could others purchase a Brand X car and never regret it...absolutely. Should my negative experience be used to prevent others from engaging in something that they might consider positive? Sounds kinda fascist to me.
