yeah, you are right dono.....so explain to me about the constitution??? would you like to start with the federalist papers and move on from there? i have yet to hear someone prove me wrong on the constitution. if you think that the cruel and unusual term doesn't apply to the living constitution then you are sadly mistaken. how do you think it became that the death penalty for minors is illegal now? the court 15yrs ago said differently!!! how can the inerpretation change with no basis other then ones own personal opinion? this is scary..people, you gotta think this stuff through!
