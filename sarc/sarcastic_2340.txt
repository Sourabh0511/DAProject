look around, the greatest majority of gun-related violence occurs were people aren't allowed to be armed, or have to go through great leaps and bounds to qualify for being armed. this is because the criminals who get their guns illegally and plans to use them to harm others know that their chances of encountering an armed victim are next to nothing, putting them in an near-absolute position of authority where they can do whatever they want. and the point is what exactly in this statement? last i checked thailand and israel were arming school teachers because too many students were either being held hostage or murdered. after the teachers became armed these rates dropped. why? because schools were no longer soft targets and threats could be met with deadly force immediately within a second's notice.
