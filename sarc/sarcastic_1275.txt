"Here is yet another example of Duo holding other people's arguments to a higher standard than he holds his own. Duo, you said ""Second, no one call actually tell the age of anyone here. To declare such when the verifiability that the claim depends on does not exist is sheer insanity."" Are you right? Anyone claiming to know age on these boards without evidence is insanity? Duo, if you are right, you are calling yourself insane. That's not going to help you out on the credibility meter. Perhaps you might want to amend some of you posts?"
