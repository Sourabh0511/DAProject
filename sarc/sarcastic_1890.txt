wow, you have a g.e.d. what happened? dropped out of high school? or did you flunk out? judging by you sentences (if you can call them that), you flunked out. and as for me, i have a computer engineering associates degree and i'm working towards my bachelors of science in computer engineering, so keep that in mind. i suppose the 'really important things' that you are learning that aren't reading and writing is how to roll a joint or take lsd since i couldn't imagine what a person who still lives in his mom's basement learns.
