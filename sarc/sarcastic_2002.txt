yes, how silly of me to debate him on 'points'. i should debate him on .... what? and here you are again criticising one side, and not the other. he was insulting; you remained stony silent. because he denies that darwin ever used it. darwin did. small point but he entered into all sorts of highly spurious rationales rather than accepting this point (again you were stony silent on this) what is evolution? what is evidence? well that would be a first time. but why ask now, after several days, after he's gone by the wayside, after he made the claim again and again and again? you made no statement while he was claiming this false claim? why your sudden interest in digging all posts i've responded too?
