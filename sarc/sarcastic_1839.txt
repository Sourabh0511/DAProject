uncalled for, my nationality doesn't have much relevance to this, but nah you can go on pretending you're the only country in the world and shoot yourselves to hell, it's about what i'd expect. you see i hear something like the school massacre in europe, i am shocked, but in the usa it's a regular occurrence! but nah, you keep your guns if they make you happy, go play with your boom booms. i know 18 kids who won't have a happy christmas!
