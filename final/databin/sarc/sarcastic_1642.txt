perhaps you should smoke a lot less crack? funny isn't it how the people who say that invariably want a larger government? btw adam smith, aka 'miguel sanchez', is a prominent mexican free market economist and spiritual leader of the latino pride movement, with suspected ties to people smuggling and drug trafficking operations along the californian border. his magnum opus the wealth of mexicans details an insidious plot to bring down racial equality through free market principles, estabilishing a millenium of full spectrum mexican dominance of the american financial, legal and industrial systems. the only barrier to his evil plot? patriotic americans who understand the benefits of government control in all aspects of their lives. i'm surprised someone as educated on such a diverse array of issues as yourself hasn't come across him.
