lol. says the one who did not even bother to open the specific post link.  huh. again, you don't care about evidence. i gave it to you and you said i never did despite the link to the specific post right there.  liar you call me? well, i guess it takes one to know one.  questionable. all that the author did was state that the evidence rejects yec. he does not argue for another form of creationism.  please stop trying to argue there is only one form of creationism.  my god you are dishonest. still avoiding why arch would replace yec with christanity eh?  apparently you think interchangeability means that the words mean two different things despite being used interchangeably as the same.
