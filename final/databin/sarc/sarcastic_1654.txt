he can't sin, get a teenage girl knocked up on a one night stand, but not sin. slaughter innocents personally or command his followers to do so but can't sin. oh yes he isn't very good at watching out for his kids. i mean look at adam and eve and then he got another chance with jesus and look how that turned out. and see above for other things he can't do.
