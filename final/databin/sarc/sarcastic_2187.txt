i must admit i was a bit confused when you came out with this: where in this discussion did i offer any solution to zimmerman (i don't remember mentioning him at all)? nor did i give any suggestion as to what i would do. so where did this 'both of you' come from? please could you also point out where i interjected pepper spray into the debate? a quote would be nice. oh, and the term 'enemy combatants' was just made up so that the bush and his partners in crime could get round international law. the geneva convention does cover them very clearly in the quote i gave.
