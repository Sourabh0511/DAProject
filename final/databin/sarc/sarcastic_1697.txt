psh if i had to f*&^ hillary i'd cheat too! i mean i'm gay but lord have mercy! lol... but getting back to the subject at hand. simone hun honestly just stop with the cook theories and whoever else even believes them. bush and dick had no idea of 9/11 we all didn't.  i find it a sad irony that we discover the warning signs after the incident... we're only human and we all make mistakes... oh and fyi we did not land on the moon.. simone told me it was made of cheese and that there were giant moon rats eating and eating until one day the moon will be gone... that's why there are holes in it. it's true!!! honestly!
