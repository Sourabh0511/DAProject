d'ya think i should? make a mel gibson film and suddenly everyone's an expert eh? well despite what his gibson-ness would have us believe, gallipoli was a case of bad luck, incompetence and generals f*cking everyone over regardless of nationality. remember we lost huge numbers of british troops too. now i don't downplay the role of the anzacs, or their losses. but this was at a time when the british considered australians to be one and the same as themselves. there was hardly the conscious effort to use the anzacs as fodder over the tommies. gallipoli was a blunder (though again not as big a blunder as populist history has us believe) for everyone, regardless of nationality. there was certainly no sinister us and them between our nations- we were essentially considered as one.
