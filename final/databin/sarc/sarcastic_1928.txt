but it makes you look a fool that you make comments without knowing. doesn't it. so you think that just because you enter a debate half-way, you can still give an uninformed opinion? weren't you the one ready to laugh at me? i won't laugh at you. i am only saddened by your personal attacks. yes, repeating yourself. i know what they say, you know what they say. i don't agree with them, on these points. answers in genesis are 'right' by your account on this occasion - see my previous post about us both being 'selective' in the information we use; again a lack of insight into your own thought processes. i disagree with them. do you agree with their claim that speciation in fact disproves evolution? i bet you've been very selective here too!
