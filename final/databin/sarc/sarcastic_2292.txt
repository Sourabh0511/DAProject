i don't see why not. if somebody is perfectly willing to murder you in cold blood despite your blind compliance i see no reason to believe that they'd hesitate if it meant crushing a skull with a bat rather than just shooting them in the face. seriously, what kind of stability are you dealing with when all it takes to motivate someone to murder is a simple question? a baseball bat isn't concealable like a handgun, is it? nor can it be readily used by someone suffering arthritis or used in a cramped location. any weapon can be used to inflict death and murder. the human body is hardly a modern marvel of resiliency and near-indestructibility. even sneezing wrong can be potentially fatal. certainly not. do you see a contradiction?
