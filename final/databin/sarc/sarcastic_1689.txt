this seems like a begging the question fallacy. lets just assume that they 'do not' have control over it...it would be the same thing for an alcoholic (which people are also born with). are you saying alcoholics should be allowed to live in this lifestyle? i guess it is societies fault emoticonxrolleyes looks like jyoshu's reactions were correct for you i am pretty surprised no one is like 'yeah, this is still a problem'..instead they are going '25%...that aint too bad'. even worse, they blame other people. in fact, robbie says gay men are acting 'recklessly' because they aren't treated as 'normal', yet he believes that gay men are ready to have families. how can you be reckless yet be ready for a family?..or rather, a good family?
