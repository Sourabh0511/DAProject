but do you ever question it for your self? or are you content to just show up .. and let someone else tell you what it all means. the rcc has made , by their own admission, mistakes in the past are you suggesting that it won't happen again? are you suggesting they never made a mistake in their interpitation of the bible? if so you might want to tell that to gallileo remember him ? he was burned at the stake for telling the rcc that the earth went around the sun!
