I dont need a sex lesson from a little boy.  Once again you missed the point( getting to be a habit).  We are talking about behaviour that was condemned by the preacher, one of which was adultery..not fornicating but I am sure the preacher would condemn that too  If you read the link you would know.  If homosexuality is condemned by god then they cannot marry in gods eyes..keeping up?  If gays cannot marry then gay sex must be outside of marriage therefore it is fornicating.  You really should try to use your little head more.  'Lets stay on topic' who made you a mod?emoticonXChicken
