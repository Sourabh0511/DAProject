i am very impressed with your ability to copy and paste links. now what this proves about what you know about it is still unproven. unless you are the one in the videos giving the lectures...and he looks like he has been studying this longer then 'almost a decade'. nice try though. what proof can you give that is pertinent to the debate about how that disproves an eternal being? also you may want to get with some of the other atheists on the site because they were pushing the eternal universe and big bounce theories as explanations in other debates. you all should get your scientific consensus on the same page.
