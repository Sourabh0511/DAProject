bs, if it's password protected, then how would they access it? then i suppose america would look lovely as the crater in the death star! you're telling me to believe that it exists even though there is no evidence that it does? once again: there's a witness in this courtroom who says that i didn't kill that guy, but i'm the only one who can see him and hear him. in other words, unless the page is showed to me, i have no reason to believe that it exists.
