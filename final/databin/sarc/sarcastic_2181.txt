sure. god commanded faithfulness in marriage. yet he never even raised an eyebrow at abraham inpregnating his maid, and went on to bestow blessings on him like it never happened. god commanded you should not steal. yet moses' brilliant idea of having the israelites borrow gold and jewelry from the egyptians they knew they never were going to repay seemed mildly humorous to god at the time. god commanded that noone should make graven images of him or anything in heaven. so what's the deal with the ark of the covenant? and the number of instances god commanded his people to kill, shortly after commanding them not to kill, well this could become a pretty long post.  i know you asked for one, but i just started rambling because so many came to mind. pick one if you want.
