ok, i understand now. all those people, including children and the fetuses of pregnant women were all sinful and god had to murder them in tsunamis, earthquakes, etc.,  is that how god deals with overpopulation? i guess that wars are part of god's plan, too, because the recent invasion of iraq wiped out more than 100,000 iraqis according to god's plan for dealing with overpopulation.
