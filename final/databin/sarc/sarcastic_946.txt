"Um, Bassman, so you, the one person in the world who is as ""pure as the wind-driven snow,"" is the one who may judge others, including Democrats. Um, for the record I grew up on the prairie and saw a goodly bit of ""wind-driven snow"" and it was not particularly pure. A feeble and laughable metaphor."
