Well it came from somewhere and presumably changed as it went along.   Careful there that ones been clearly shown to be the case - in a laboratory environment to boot. Not to mention in the form of a hydrogen bomb!   You mean that the planets and stars have always existed? Really - so how come we see stars being made in nurseries via the Hubble telescope.   So you don't believe that life had an origin! WOW so you think its always been present on the Earth? Not even the bible goes that far! And you fail to account for the observation that there IS life.   Thats not an evolutionary theory, at least not a scientific one. Kinds is a theological construct not a biological one and MOST creationists use the KINDS thing as a support for their arguments.
