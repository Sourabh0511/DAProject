my hat is off to california! was my post #43 right or wrong? now we just need new york to follow suit. now my question. if the federally funded programs can not create new stem cell lines, can california create them and then share? voila! federal funding on useful research. then watch 'em all stand in line for the cure. another question. has anybody else thought to ask gwb why, if stem cell research is false hope, did he fund any of it -- badly?
