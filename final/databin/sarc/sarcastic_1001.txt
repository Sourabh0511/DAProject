"Trying to argue with a person who is babbling nonsense is not my idea of a productive time to spend my time. I've explained myself and that's the end of it.   You can label my posts anything you want but that doesn't mean anything. It just means you are proficient in throwing out insults. So for purposes of this discussion I crown you the ""insult king"" of this forum."
