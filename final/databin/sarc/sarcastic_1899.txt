yes secular governments work. nor does it take much to see the philosophical similarities, as pointed out by trebor, between a religion, such as christianity or islam and communism, socialism, capitalism, totalitarism or a monarchy, but it does require an additional step, hence my comment of 2+2+2.  but just for kicks, let's say i am fully on board with communism as a religion and am now jumping ship on the idea. this would be the only reason you can give, other than what you have misunderstood which is explained abvove, that makes the study flawed. which doesn't take a genius to grasp makes no sense whatsover. so take your time, think about it, because there is an argument to made for your view and i am surprised nobody picked up on it, but let's see if you can figure it out on your own.
