"Your problem is that you take the Bible as the Literal Word of the Invisible man which everyone with a brain knows it is NOT. There are other ""Sins' listed in the old testament that you ignore and try to explain away but you know as well as I that Jesus did not change the Laws. If you want others to live by your False book of fairy tales it would be a Good Idea for you to read it and follow it yourself first. Choosing one or two scriptures and using them to attack people is only making you look foolish.  "
