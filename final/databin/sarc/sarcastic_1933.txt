doh, you used the 'l' word. how dare ye! (tsk, tsk) :p don't you know? you can't use the term 'lifestyle,' you have to use the description of lifestyle instead. that usually works much better. gotta know the rules to talk with the gay rights folk here, don't ya know? lol see, if you use the word, they can't stay on topic and so then your use of the 'l' word becomes the topic. it's just too damn distracting for 'em.
