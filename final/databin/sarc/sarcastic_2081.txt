your foot would do service as a colander. in australia, a weapon may be legally held for many reasons. self defence is not one of them. you might legally own a weapon for sport shooting, but use it to defend yourself. how hard is that to understand? for a supposed 'expert' not to realise that a drawn pistol is not pointing at ones foot, is a major error commonly made by fantasy gunners.
