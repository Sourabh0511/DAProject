and bill clinton didn't? obama doesn't? emoticonxdonno let me help you with that. emoticonxangel she's a conservative! i'll bet her upcoming debate with biden will get far more attention than mccain/obama did! i'll sure be watching! word has it that the moderator is an obama lover.  i'm just surprised that so many consider it so important how one performs in these quick witted, personality contests. just because a person is slightly off the mark in wits doesn't mean he/she would not be a good leader - able to make sound political decisions.  looks aside, pelosi's a dingbat compared to palin. she gets a free pass from the news media - ho hum.
