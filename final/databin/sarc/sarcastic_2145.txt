what? naaah,... all we have to do is deny the suspects are 'persons' then we can do any emoticonxcensored thing we want to with them and there's no moral aspects to it at all,... just like abortion and (at one time) slavery. one thing that has always puzzled me,... 'how is it that enemy combatants and convicted murderous terrorists can come away with more rights and sympathy from the left than a prebirth little human child can?' (scratching head) emoticonxconfused how is it that a leftist can see more outcries for humanity in a whale, dolphin, spotted owl or field mouse than they do in an actual prebirth human child? one of the great mysteries of the modern world, i suppose.
