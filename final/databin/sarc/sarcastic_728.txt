Really? What book is that, because I have seen no quotes or links to any source of any info at all from you anywhere above on this page.

Here's my original post again, I challenge you to explain how these alleged stone age sheep herders whom you scoff at and mock described contemporary living creatures which paleontologists today identify as dinosaurs, from skeletal remains?
