go out there and find all kinds of democrat-led, black-led, white-led, mexican-led, etc.. efforts to protect gay rights. just because you can't find them doesn't mean they're against them. saying all republicans are against gay rights because one of them is, is bigoted, stereotypical and childish. quite moronic too. is it also your claim that all blacks are prejudiced because they haven't formed the naawp yet? grow up.
