What about people who believe in something so much they are willing to suffer - even die - for it? I thought you Christians were really into that kind of thing! emoticonXAngel I ask because the history of the Documentary Hypothesis is filled with those who were persecuted for daring to suggest that evidence led away from the tradition that Moses had written the entire Pentateuch. Another case of the church strangling free thought!
