like i said in another thread, the argument i hear most often from so-called 'pro-choicers' is that you cannot legislate morality. well then what can you legislate? every law in existence is legislation of morality! by that way of thinking, then we should have no laws. if someone kidnaps and murders your 3-year-old child, then let's hope the murderer goes free because we cannot legislate morality!
