do you actually think that asking worthless questions will help your side? oh wait, obviously you do, that's all you ever ask. why are you trying so hard to deny the fact that conception originates a new organism?  irrelevant  that conception is the beginning of that new organism's life and physical existence? irrelevant that conception is in that respect, the birth of a new organism?  my definition does not allow for this conclusion. why does that fact bother you so much? if you are right, then all words are worthless and meaningless. if you are right every word means every other word.
