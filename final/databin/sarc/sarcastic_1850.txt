since we're at war with radical islam and they have attacked our homeland once already and have promised a repeat performance. it is ludicrous, irresponsible and suicidal to consider that investigating people of islamic descent before allowing them entry to be a discriminatory policy. especially since terrorists don't fight like men but are committed only to hit and die/run sneak attacks. but i'm not surprised that you're blinded by political correctness when you should be concerned about your families security. emoticonxrolleyes
