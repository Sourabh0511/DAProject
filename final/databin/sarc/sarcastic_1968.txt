have you ever even heard of www.google.com? http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=...e+search&meta= and this is your measure of what makes something true? well then, the epic of gilgamesh, the illiad, and the oddysey must also be true by that reasoning. they've survived just as long, and are still being studied to this day for their insights into those ancient cultures.
