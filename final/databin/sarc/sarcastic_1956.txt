oh, so business owners don't make 'real' contributions to society? whoa boy, slow down there. i didn't say that government offices should be passed down. what are you going to do...make inheritence illegal? you didn't read my answer obviously. just because people have money doesn't mean they have to share it. the government doesn't have the right to take money away from the rich and give it to the poor. so what if rich people don't give money to the poor! it's their choice. god tells us to give money to the poor, but he also gave us a free will. it's not the governments responsibility to help the poor, it's the church's responsibility.
