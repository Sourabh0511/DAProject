"And how is that? Your stereotypical view is supposed to represent ""truth""?? LMAO. B**** (and I mean that ""lovingly"") I'm friggin married. For 10 years. I don't accept ""gay sex proposals"", unless it's from my husband. And he ain't ""white"". I had my flings with y'all....and y'all ain't right. I moved on. And learn to use English ""correctly"". A remedial English course is recommended. And I have never lived in Sodom. I'm a Houstonian. B^^^^."
