fend not really. they took it out because it was a blatant pro-christian argument.  and those two threads only serve to prove my point. the only iders are fundamentalists christians or muslims. there is no science in id. only godiddit.  explain to me how the same processes that date geological areas that are used by evolution and the big fossil fuel corporations is wrong.  explain to me how its correct when the fossil fuel industry uses it to find fossil fuels but when scientists use it to support evolution, it's false. that makes no sense whatsoever.  explain to me why something tried and true needs to be reformatted. or are all these products science brought us fake?  the delusion of creation.
