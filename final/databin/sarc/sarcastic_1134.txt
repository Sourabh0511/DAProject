"First off, no one says that if there is evil, there can't be a God. They say that if there's evil, then God can't be omnipotent and all benevolent. Let's keep the topics straight. Also, I see no way in which the existence of good bolsters the argument that God exists. I could posit the existence of a God of popcorn, and then say ""look, here's some popcorn, my God must be real!"" Somehow, I don't think that would convince you."
