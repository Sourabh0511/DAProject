so why have darwinists ignored symbiosis for decades if it was so compatible? same with developmental biology? why have developmental biologists been locked away in closets, never to be heard from until recently when they've forced themselves upon the scientific community? the reality is you have no choice: accept that organisms cooperate with each other and respond purposefully and intelligently to the environment or else. tell me though: do you now admit that individuals evolve, not populations?
