ok, the absolutly positively true story. god did exist. but, satan being the wiley deciever he is got him with that very clever paradox ploy. 'god, if you are truely all powerful, can you make yourself not exist?' satan asked. 'but of course.' he replied and with that...*poof* he was gone. that explains why he doesn't do anything. no miracles, no prayers answer, nothing...he's gone. and, for those fools who doubt this, i refer you to the book of job. witness how god jumps to the tune of satan when god withdraws his protection from his loyal and faithful servant...merely to prove a point to satan...without cause!
