never said anything about a 'lost speech'. but who knows? he may have had his speech writers prepare half a dozen different speeches. the community organizer knows when to push and when to back off. there was enough of a public outcry for him to realize that this was not the time to push. so he backed off and wasted the country's time by re-hashing old wisdoms. i am rather amused about the labels thrown out by you, simon and foundit. just because i had the audacity to criticize the anointed one i am a hysterical racist. keep them coming.
