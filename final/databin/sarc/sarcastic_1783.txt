i can't help it if fairy tales are dear to your heart dude, i'm just telling it like it is.  christians all over the country try to claim the gospels are in harmony..and very rarely , if ever, have i found a christian who will admit the contradictions in the bible. they try to explain away contradictions with lies and made up versions of their own but will never admit the truth.... no loss here, i have never since i came here hid the fact i do not like religion. it's nothing personal against anyone in particular, but if you happen to be religious and fall under the weight of truth i can't help if your feelings get hurt. would you rather me feed you a line of xxxx so you will fall for it, i mean come on, religion already did that right>.....emoticonxbouncer
