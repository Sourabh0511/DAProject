is this the pro-sodomite woman talking here? where does it say in the bible that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy makes one feel squeaky clean like you claim to be?  where does jesus then say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of? obviously you have created a carnal, iniquity-loving jesus that's different than the jesus of the bible. one more time now, preppy: where does jesus say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of? got a scripture where he says gay sex sin suddenly became a righteous endeavor? obviously you have created a carnal, iniquity-loving jesus that's different than the jesus of the bible. so go preach that trash to someone who's buying it.
