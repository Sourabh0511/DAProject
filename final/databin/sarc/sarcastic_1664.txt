i am surprised to hear you, a card-carrying christian, defending the civil rights of polygamists! wonders will never cease!  obviously the point flew right past your noggin. gay people are discriminated against because they are gay! but then, you folk think that's just fine. a few years ago, you'd have been blowing hard about 'activist' judges allowing interracial marriage. how dare they stand up for equal rights! emoticonxrolleyes
