atheists believe in god.... they just don't want to believe in god because they are in rebellion to god maybe in your mind, because you can't see a world without god. a parallel is that of a parent and child. so atheists are naughty children? and he or she then rebells to the point of extreme anger. atheists are extremely angry? oh right, like those atheist terrorists, or the atheists that campaign at the funerals of dead soldiers. atheists are just angry at god for no real reason care to prove this?
