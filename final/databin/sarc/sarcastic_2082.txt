there is much evidence of long-term relationships for gay couples(that do last more than five years)... http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cg...ng1h59r5q1.dtl http://www.usatoday.com/money/perfi/...-seniors_x.htm http://www.usc.edu/isd/archives/onei...alecouple.html http://www.abc.net.au/correspondents...4/s1065302.htm being gay is not an illness, so it cannot be cured. that is not true, as joe pointed out, and has been pointed out over and over again in this forum. sounds like a closet case trying to convince himself to be straight, or a guy who expects every woman to want him. therefore what we are talking about, doesn't exist? give me a break.
