i have never heard a conservative who was pro gay let alone pro same sex marriage. do you know of any? there is an old term that seems to apply 'if the shoe fits'. please i would like to know who these conservatives are that want gay people to be able to legally marry. who are they? since as you say i speak in generalities then you should have no problem listing these pro gay or por gay marriage conservatives. just because someone believes that the government should not be in the marriage busisness, as a libertarian, doesn't mean they support gay marriage.
