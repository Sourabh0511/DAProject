"I think you're VERY mistaken.I'm not a republican. Nor a democrat.Never been registered as anything other than 'independent'.I'm such because I think.Unlike a party parrot that you seem to be yourself.Since I'm neither...who the hell can ""I"" be in the minority?Must be your biggoted knee-jerk reaction to think that anyone who doesn't think like you and slurp the Flavor Aid is the opposition and as such must be in the 'enemy party'.And you are a hater because you verbiage is hate filled, caustic and ever insulting. And not in a funny, jestful way but full of vitriol and bile."
