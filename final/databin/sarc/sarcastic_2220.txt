"Lemme guess, in real life you're a lawyer, correct? You must be because you're extremely hypertechnical to the point of absurdity. It doesn't matter what you call them, be it criminal or gang member of dope dealer or home invader, if somebody breaks the law then they're a criminal and it's as simple as that.Seriously dude, you're trying to get off on a technicality here. Like a lawyer trying to argue ""Your honor my client isn't a prostitute, she's a female escort"". Doesn't matter what you call it or what you try to pass it off as, a criminal is a criminal regardless of what their formal title is.So which is Ripskar, do criminals have guns and are likely to shoot you in the face and kill you, or do they not have guns at all. It's one or the other, it can't be both."
