if we killed more people that were guilty of their crime more people would not want to commit the crime because of the circumstances. if they don't care about the circumstances they are insane. 'i think, about what they've done wrong in society is by teaching/encouraging/inspiring them, not killing.' so you want the government to brainwash them?  are you kidding me? what planet do you live on?! 'oh, you killed someone but we're not going to punish you at all you just have to go to therapy.' you're joking right?
