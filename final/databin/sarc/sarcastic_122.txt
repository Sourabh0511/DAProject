****! I go to Home Depot, have a basic understanding of car maintenance, love to fish, always wear sensible shoes and will frequently go without make-up. I never knew I was a XXXX. Man if I can't get my stereotypes right, I guess I will just have to give up my crush on the cute dude guitar player I saw last night..... :p
