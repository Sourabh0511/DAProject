so what is it that isn't true? are you saying nasa didn't spend 12 billion dollars developing a zero gravity pen or that russia didn't use a pencil? and since you're so anal about a simple joke, go ahead and support your claim that anything my joke says isn't true, with actual evidence. your opinion doesn't carry much weight with me.
