let's say that the law, based upon some kind of verifiable scientific data, decides that some folks are inferior to other folks, and thus less of a person? you know, if the law said 'because you are black, you are less of a person than shomeone who is white. you shouldn't be upset though, all scientific data suggests that you, because you are black, are truly inferior to those who are white.' would you think, because the law said so, that a black person was in fact a non-person?
