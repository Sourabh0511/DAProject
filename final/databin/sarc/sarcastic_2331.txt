"Some slightly earlier history shows that Clinton wasn't quite that worried about Bin Laden. In 1996, the CIA had Bin Laden pinpointed on a ranch in Afghanistan. It needed permission ONLY from the Clinton White House (not Congress) to vaporize it - it was in the middle of nowhere. An official from the ""United Arab Emirates"" was with him, that was Clinton's excuse for not doing it. What did he think they were doing, making cookies, or did it dawn on him that they may have been up to no good?Thanks a lot, William Jefferson Clinton!"
