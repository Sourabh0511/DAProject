yeah a spending problem increasing our deficit by 800 billion  dollars by not taxing the muckety mucks that outsource american jobs to china. oh and where is this borrowed revenue coming from to lets the super rich get a break? china. what are the walton's the owners of wal mart getting by this deal? a 32 billion dollar tax break! i wonder what we could do with 32 billion dollars hmm? you think their going to increase employee wages? healthcare? pump it back into the economy? hell no.... what a scandle. it's the end of this country as we flippin know it people and personally it makes my stomach hurl. go ahead easy. beg the walton's for your lost job back, or your wages, or to pay for your kids books out of charity when the state funds run dry.... go ahead and beg....
