so the old man was doing something criminal by carrying a firearm for self defence? the bar***d! how can you do such a thing, breaking the law like that, or maybe if the criminal who beat him up was the one who actually deserved to be charged, or better shot. so you think that this man who was following the law (texas case) deserved to go to jail for defending his property and anybody else who may have been hurt, killed as a result of their next crime? are you actually insane? have you lost your marbles? what is wrong with you?
