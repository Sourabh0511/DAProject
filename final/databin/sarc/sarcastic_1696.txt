wow, in your very warped world view, people with moral values that defend the most defenseless among us and speak for those who can't speak for themselves are seen as morally perverted by you? how terribly pathetic of you capo. but sadly, i'm not the least bit surprised at how incredibly shallow your perspective is. what boggles the mind though is that you're unable to empathize with a whole class of human beings whom you once were yourself. just think about it capo, can you see what that say's about you?
