'define'? as if it's a definition? tell me, archie: precisely how ignorant of this topic are you? so you want me to give you the better part of what could amount to a semester-long advanced college course in a single post? do you really think that you'll understand curvature of space-time as induced by matter when you can't even understand the difference between a scientific theory and a drunken guess? do you really think i have any inclination of trying to tell you about the technicalities of relativity when you don't understand that light and gamma rays are the same thing? get real. you need to get your head out of your xxx before you'll be able to even hear me.
