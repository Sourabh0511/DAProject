orion's follies: some other goodies from that site... never linked to those specific articles.  but before orion gets too self-righteous, let's look at some ot the topics he considered 'funny' in a link he gave over at the usat creation / evolution forum: christian crimes - pastor molests widow's boys - pastor molests adopted daughters - priest molests altar boys - late for church - christian racist kidnapper - music pastor molests - bush's faith-based failure - pastor molest, guns, drugs - $400,000 missing - priest molests - church youth coach molests - bush suppresses student prayer - sen byrd's 'white ('n' word)'  is this funny? it's apparently real funny to orion. his link also had a pornographic sub-link on the virgin mary, describing her in graphic, profane language.  orion - christ-deniers like you and brummer need a lot of help.
