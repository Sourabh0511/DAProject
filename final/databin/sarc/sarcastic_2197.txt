i doubt you know enough about carl bogus speedy defense of bellesiles and his dependance on a flawed study by loftin which was also in turn defended by jack rakov who later apologized out of embarrasment? want to take a shot and drag this farther off topic and embarrass yourself and star gazer and any other adherents? you well know you are in the wrong ballpark as has been pointed out many times on this very board. keep clutching at straws you will never get enough to build that strawman. beating a dead horse is bad enough...all 9 justices agreed the right was individual in heller.
