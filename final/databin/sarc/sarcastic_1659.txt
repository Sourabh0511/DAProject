it looks like you have tried to analize everything i say as being 'my' life experiences. i really enjoy your abuse , i would love to meet up with you some day. my life is fantastic actually. i dont know why i have to keep repeating that. what about those in haiti right now ? what about others? i think they are more important than your fucking sulking over the americans lousy pronunciations.or me whining over you being an arsehole. as for amy winehouse , no reputable establishment would dare touch the skank.
