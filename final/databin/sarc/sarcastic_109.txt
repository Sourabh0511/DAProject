Good point here, because the media never insults right-wingers....emoticonXRolleyes   I don't think anybody is denying that Imus' comments were tasteless and offensive. The point that is being made here is that he has the right to make such comments. He didn't discriminate against anyone. He simply said something stupid. If this is going to be considered a crime, we would all be locked away.
