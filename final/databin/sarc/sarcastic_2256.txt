shall we regress to babble?  the government is already heavily into the term 'marriage'. not only the us government, but governments all over the world refer to 'marriage' as the legal union of a man and a woman. changing the definition in one country would likely create confusion everywhere.  what if some countries required you to clarify whether you were married to a man or a woman in order to get a visa? do we need to define several types or classes of 'married couple'. what if some countries objecting to the concealment of the gender of one's spouse instituted a death penalty for it? i would argue that legally joined same-sex couples should have all the benefits and rights afforded married couples, but not for redefining 'marriage' solely for the purpose of calling them such.
