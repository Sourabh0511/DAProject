Ahh but what if all the shirts have only american flags on them. Would it them be a group of patiotic americans and their children? I mean you do tend to see american flag wear, including tee shirts, everywhere. Would it still be considered a protest if all of them had american flag shirts on them.  AHHHH Joe I it hit me of course this is like Ghandis' salt march.
