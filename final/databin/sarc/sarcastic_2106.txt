his own drummer all right... you might say that the ot god has a bit of a problem upstairs...  funny you should mention lot's wife. lot's family are the sole survivors of the destruction of an entire city, for reasons which are debated. lot's wife is turned into a pillar of salt just because she looked backwards as she was leaving- a natural human response. gen. 19:26 clearly states that she was behind lot. therefore in order to find out what happened to his wife, wouldn't he also had to have looked back? so, anyway, turning around gets you turned into a pillar of salt, but incest is a ok! it must be scary believing in such an inconsistant and crazy god...
