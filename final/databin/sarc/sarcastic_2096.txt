no... a debased intellect has things backwards, that would clearly be minds of your ilk buddy. so.. what then? your heart tells you to go jump off a cliff? on contrast that old you book you claim tells me to sit down and live a day, guess what i'm gonna do? go live a day... and avoid watching them have to scrape you off the ground. that old book is about reason, respect, love decency and standards that preserve life... a fallen heart cannot be trusted. i trust a heart governed by that book... rather than a mind with no self control living for the 'heart' - they give heart a bad name. sorry pal... i dont' expect you to understand it, and i am fine with that - it is your choice, but it hasn't been wrong ever, and never wronged anybody.
