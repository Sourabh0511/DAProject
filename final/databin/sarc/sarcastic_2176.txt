1) why is the philosophy of jefferson twisted?? if you can't say its because you are a typical anti american liberal. 2) nothing to suppoprt it? if anti-american liberal positions were made illegal as per the constitution then everyone would have to vote among the conservatives.  the political spectrum would simple shift so that both extremes were in the intelligent range. on the far left you'd have romney and on the far right you'd have ron paul. now that would be an intelligent election consistent with our very very conservative constitution.
