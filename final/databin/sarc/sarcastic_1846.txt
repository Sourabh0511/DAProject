i am amused by how some people can look at an article of an anti-gay marriage advocate attacking a gay marriage advocate, and the person reading the article wants to focus on what qualifies as 'oppression' and how gays could have it worse... emoticonxdonno  just out of curiousity, do you have any comment as to whether or not the attack was wrong?
