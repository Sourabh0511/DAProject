wrong again daewoo; but at least you are painfully consistent. i am merely pointing out the hypocrisy and level of ignorance obama displays every time he opens his economically clueless and divisive mouth. but then, who would ever accuse you of getting anything right? once again, the buffet rule is for the gullible and clueless to glom onto in a vacuum of reality and the fact that it would do nothing to solve this nations problems and is merely a diversion from the massive failure this president has been, more so than even carter.  i cant say i am surprised you would glom onto such an idiot talking point.  it is only strange for someone who is so completely clueless that they cannot even comprehend a simple thread premise.  so were you born this clueless, or deliberately play the role of someone who is patently clueless?
