it's my first day and i'm already wishing forums had an ignore button. this really is my first day, and i am frankly flabbergasted. is this (archie-types) an ongoing problem here, or an isolated individual? i feel like i'm arguing with my 6 year old niece. i'm asking everyone out there who has been there for a while. seriously. as a former christian, i have numerous christian friends whose conversation and opinions i respect and think i could learn something from - but, well...jesus, is this the norm around here? this is not a rhetorical question.
