that doesn't suprise me. again i'm not surprised that your first reaction to the idea that people aren't equal would be to enslave some and that your second idea would be to subjegate women. this reveals way too much about your nature. it ain't pretty. try living homeless for a year then get back to me on whether you saw yourself as equal to someone on '1million a year' emoticonxrolleyes now if the '1million a year' person gave the homeless person 1/2 million a year, then they would be equal, because equality is at the entre of such socialist ideals.
