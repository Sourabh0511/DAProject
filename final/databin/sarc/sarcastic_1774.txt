reproduction oh yeah, because our 7 billion high population, with estimates for 10 billion by the end of the century, really needs to force gay people to do it. if the person is religious in the christian religion, it only damns those who sleep with another man as he does a women. your sexual orientation itself is not bad. and anyway, it's their own problem, love the sinner, hate the sin, as jesus said. i'm not sure about other religions specific text against gays. if he wants to. i talked about how people shouldn't be forced to, i said that some people could.
