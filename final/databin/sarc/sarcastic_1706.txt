no i'm not. well you certainly should be. to me it doesn't matter how the fetus got there, and seriously, why is it relevant for you to know that? wow...i'd say i'm surprised but i'm really not. so you're saying that people who don't want a baby stupid enough to have unprotected sex are on an equal playing field with those who properly applied protection which failed? that's ludicrous and you really should know better.  well. with condoms.. you have no baby. and with abortion, you don't have any baby either.. you left out a few important details there buddy. with the killing of a 3-month old with an axe you have no baby. but its the same result! yippee!
