You know, if the God deniers even let the baby out of the mother's womb alive to begin with then he's already one step ahead of the game.  As for what to do with him then, show me under the New Covenant where Jesus said to stone kids?  Personally, I think we should stone obese, jaded statues of weird looking holy men.
