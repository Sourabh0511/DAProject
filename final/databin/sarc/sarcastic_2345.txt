to review. we have this piece of wonderful news stating that we cannot keep illegal products out of the country, and we should just give up and quit.    major panel: drug war failed; legalize marijuana  new jobs program by sinjin for the mexican drug cartels. inport illegal guns in too.    and this news from a country much like ours.   australia. with much much more gun control than you want at this particular moment, and they still have the illegal gun problem.  and yet you still insist on laying this off on our constitution? the probability of success is zero, and you know it! so what is your real reason for burdening the constitution? ooooo! ooooo! i know! you dont like it!  isnt that what you told charlie?
