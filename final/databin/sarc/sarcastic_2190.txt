let's look up all the definitions, shall we? here's where you got 'yours': as you can see, the definition you cited is only used once, and even then it is just one of two from that source.  i notice you ignored all of the responses to you on the thread and decide to just post this piece of work without answering people. we are waiting, oh sentient one. we have shown you creatures that match all of these definitions (or at least all of the definitions that are seen in each and every source - see how alike each one is?) - now show us how humans are the only sentient beings in the universe.
