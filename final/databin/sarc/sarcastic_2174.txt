and what are the choices of the so called 'pro-life' people? suffer through a rape or incest induced pregnancy, die from pregnancy complications without a chance of terminating it, or force women who took proper precautions which failed to go through an unwanted pregnancy while likely losing her job, scholarships, any chance at life, etc. some great choices there emoticonxrolleyes i'd swear the whole group of them have an underlying misogynistic syndrome.
