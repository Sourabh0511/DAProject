The vast majority of scientists do not believe in Creationism, and all those people you listed who say there are only 2 varients evolution or creationism--they are't anthropological or theological experts. All they know is their westernized view. Their opinions have no reflection on Biology in that sense. THey should stick to Biology. There is only 1 true way--that's evolution. THe other's are wishful thinking, whether they be the primordial flood, the divine parrot, or magic god who made people from dust.
