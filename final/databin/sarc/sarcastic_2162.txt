parents want convenience and to pacify their children with a 'happy meal'. most kids don't ask for lettuce, they ask for burgers. wonder why mcdonalds doesn't add a soy burger to their menu? they have salads and adding soy products would be another way to show they 'care' about health. the answer might be they have done consumer research and found the costs to create/market a new soy product outweight the profits.
