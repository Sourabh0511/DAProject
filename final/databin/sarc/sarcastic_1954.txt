not true at all. hate crime legislation protects straights as well as gays. nothing 'special' there. so you make a claim, but can provide no example to document the veracity of your claim. meh... what i expected. the ruling is garbage. 'ex-gays' are supposedly straight, right? so they are already protected under existing legislation. if we had a bunch of democrats who changed to republicans, and then insisted they should be known as 'ex-democrats', would we need another legal status for them? no.
