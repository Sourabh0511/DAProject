i am looking for you to recognize that a pregnancy can't successfully happen without addressing the circumstances of the mother - whatever those may be. you can dismiss everything but health/life of the mother but i can pretty damned well assure you she won't. and whether you like it or not - the pregnancy can't succeed without her. get it? she is not a barbie you can bend to your will with law. do you see her? do you recognize that babies grow and live inside women? address all her issues or you will fail in your endeavors. oh - and i don't require your sympathy - my life is great.
