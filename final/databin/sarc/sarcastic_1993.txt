i don't know, terran. are you scared poohbear? do you actually have any evidence to bring to us? we'd love to see some! really we would! if you could show us some hardcore, physical evidence that proves god did it, it would be the scientific revelation of the century! oh what's that? you don't have any? not even a poorly crafted straw-man argument? damn, and here i was thinking you were capable. oh yes, and if you could give us some firm, solid evidence that darwin is burning in hell, we would all drop our copies of origin and bow down the lord.  whats that? you don't have any...?
