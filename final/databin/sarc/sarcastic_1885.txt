i love how you claim that the teabag party is not affiliated with the republicans, who are they going to vote with ?.. the democrats?.. they may not claim to be republicans but last i checked we only have two major parties representing us in the house and senate, with maybe one or two independents.the tea bag party isn't big enough to control anything without republicans so enlighten me, who are they going to vote with to destroy what obama has accomplished so far?...
