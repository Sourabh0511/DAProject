I think it would be best for neither one to have a gun, as there would be no chance of me getting hurt. After all, I could beat up a guy armed with a plastic fork. However, if the hijacker has a gun, I'd like someone (not me, I'm half blind in each eye, I'd probably hit a passanger or something) to have a gun.
