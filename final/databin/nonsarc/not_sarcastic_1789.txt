i'm not 100% sure what set of facts you are working from, but they are not the correct ones i assure you. way more jewish people were killed than died in the iraq war. when you add everyone killed in wwii iraq is not even a comparison. let me make it clear, i'm debating the lesser of two evils here, (speaking of the war, i'm not for the assassination of bush. you can't kill someone for being an idiot, if so kill everyone who elected him, not just him... which would be more people than wwii and iraq war combined by the way)... where was i? oh yeah, there's no comparison. it's an evil (though crazy) ass who caused millions upon millions to die, vs. spoiled governor's son way too dumb for his position listening to douchebags like dick.
