14 or 12... that is a ridiculous statement. drinking can affect the brain growth, and it goes through it most radical transformation at that age. oh yeah let's all stuff up the new generations brains and crap.. smart idea. if they were able to dink legally at that age it would encourage more to drink. many around that age aren't able to find alcohol really. it would make the situation worse than making it better.. the increase of binge drinking would also increase, it is at where it now because usually a person of that age, if they are able, cannot acquire a high amount of alcohol.
