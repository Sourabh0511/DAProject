so their support of bush (so you say) means exactly what? that they were listening to the sound bytes dished out by bush's rhetoric? and where is bush is the man and jim's trucking? usually they're all over it when someone says something bad about the american people. oh, that's right... it's ok when a person on the right says it, it's when it said by a liberal like moore that it becomes an issue.
