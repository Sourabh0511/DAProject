see there is such a thing as heterosexual privledge. some heterosexuals will do anything, or say anything to protect this privledge. for the christianist it is all about control, and money. the christianist will say anything or do anything to maintian their money and control. take own own archangel, for example, in everyone of his posts he extols his religious beliefs and his belief that everyone should be both hetero and his brand of christian. one must ask themselves; why does he peach against something that does not personally effect his life? i have come to the conclusion that he is afraid that he will loose his heterosexual privledge and his control as a christian.
