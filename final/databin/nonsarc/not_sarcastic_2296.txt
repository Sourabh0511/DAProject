bin laden said on that tape that muslims should support iraq. why? iraq is secular. he shouldn't want iraq to be supported... he hates non-muslims. hmm... thistown, who cares what people think? it's a bad idea to set foreign policy by opinion polls. 85% of our population was opposed to entering ww ii before pearl harbor while hitler was killing millions, and we knew all about it. that was the wrong thing to do.  i bet the chancellor is relaxing with a cool glass of french wine waiting for his term to end...his people hate him. he's holding his stance to gain popularity, playing politics. our president blew him off, he's killed relations, and he knows it.
