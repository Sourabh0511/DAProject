dear thetruth, i have posted it as a serious topic. and of course it is meant to get people talking, thinking and arguing. if you were watching/listening to the trump press conference that obama brink into the middle of (beceause he was getting slaughtered), you would take this seriously. btw, on may 23rd (the day after he finisheds the last apprentice show), we can expect some announcement! what it will be i don't know, but i bet it will be trump confirming he will run for president. andy
