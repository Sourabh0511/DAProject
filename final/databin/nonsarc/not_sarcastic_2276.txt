that is a specious argument. the constitution is not an embodiment of what is good and evil for humans to do, but of what is of value in a free society. the constitution does not judge the goodness and badness of human character. ideas for laws come from morality? the concept of morality came from a desire to survive as we evolved. so you see the law preventing someone from interfering with your life as the same as the law allowing someone to interfere with your life?
