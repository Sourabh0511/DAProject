that's a real laugh, coming from someone with so little knowledge of the legal and justice systems as you. do you even know what goes into obtaining a search warrant? do you know what the limitations are regarding the scope of a search warrant and how it has to be narrowly tailored to something specific and nothing else? right. and it was ca law that lead to a father's children being murdered because he thought he was obligated to keep his guns locked up at all time, making them inaccessible even in a true life or death emergency. it was also california law that proved just how registration can, does and will, lead to confiscation. they proved our case for us and showed everyone that we weren't paranoid, and instead knew exactly what we were talking about.
