of course i know that i could be wrong but i would have to be proven wrong through rational arguement, not just claims. have you ever stopped to think that perhaps you could be wrong? either way, we already discussed this issue of whether people can have opinions about abortion law. perhaps you are having a 'senior moment' and don't remember our discussion. i really don't feel like repeating this whole discussion all over again for your benefit. indeed, you do seem to repeat your questions quite often. if you don't like someone's answer, don't just repeat the question - address their answer. if you don't remember our discussion, it started pretty much around post #861. unless you have something new to say that we didn't already discuss, then i think we pretty much covered it and left it at a disagreement.
