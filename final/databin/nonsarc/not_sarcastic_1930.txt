Use some basic comprehension indeed. How do you think Dohzhansky 'produced' assortative mating? It was by letting the laboratory population go on interbreeding for enough generations - exactly as happens when assortative mating occurs within or between natural populations. What, did you imagine he operated on them, or something? Geeeeez..
