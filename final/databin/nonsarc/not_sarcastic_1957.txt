well, since we are talking about a gay man, i would guess it would most likely be masculine. yeah, you are being kinda homophobic. why would you possibly care if a gay man sees you in the shower? they're not going to do anything to you. if you treat someone differently for no reason other then the fact that they're gay, that's homophobia. gays are just like everyone else, excpect they're sexually attracted to the same gender. their interests cover the same spectrum as yours, sex aside. they are just as likely to be masculine or feminine as a straight man. gays are, in everyway outside of sexual preference, just like straights. so while you can certainly be selective about who your friends are, if you write someone off just for being gay that would be a shame, and a sign of prejudice.
