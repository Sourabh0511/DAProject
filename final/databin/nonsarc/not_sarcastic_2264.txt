yeah you're saying what it isn't but not saying what it is. i'm not sure what you mean as physical either. can i ask you out straight -- are you suggesting a metaphysical component to 'you'? this questions just, i feel, needs to be answered because i'm still trying to grasp what your saying. to a degree? as soon as it changes you are something else surely? i would be wraith +1 or, after a heavy night out wraith -20 -- the 'wraith' bit is just seemingly a conveniance to show nothing more than perceived lineage -- i'm not the same frame of refference at any given point as i was a second ago. i might as well be called cow +20 after eating, and assimilating a beef burger, the lineage part really is quite meaningless.
