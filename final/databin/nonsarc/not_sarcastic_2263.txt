once again when is my life, what i do, and who i love, who i marry, any more thier business then theirs is to me? you still haven't answered my question. why do they get a say in my life yet i don't get the same say in their lives? anyone who wants to but into other peoples lives in the way these religious xxxxxx are is just cruel and evil. it is my life my family not theirs. they get theirs yet try and stop me from having mine that is unjust. you are defending an unjust system.
