if you think marriage is sacred then why are you trying to change what it is? i can't say this enough times...marriage is a word that describes a union between man and women. no one created the word marriage and then decided what it would apply to. someone saw and event and gave this event a word...this would be marriage. this 'event' has been sacred since as long as we have records to show. and now, some wish to make it sacred for themselves while destroying the sacred institute that the majority of us wish to keep.
