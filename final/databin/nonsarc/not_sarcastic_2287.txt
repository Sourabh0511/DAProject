ms. bennet, in your opinion, is the anglican church apostolic? if so, what is the case that it presents for apostolic succession? the roman church did not start as an imperial church. the empire wasn't around for 300 years or so. i think many martyrs of the faith would differ with that assertion. it started at peter's appointment as the foundation of the church and was solidified in the upper room after jesus' resurrection. why do you desire to receive communion at a catholic church?
