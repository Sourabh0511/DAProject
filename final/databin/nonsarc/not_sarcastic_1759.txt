it is not appropriate on this site to call people names. i understand that you are still learning in school and are busy, but i think that they taught basic spelling and grammar at a much early age than 16, so there is really no excuse! i did take the time to google your school, but you are too young to realize that maybe this is not the only coolidge hs in the country... so i went with the first google result... i am not impressed, the school gets a 4 out of 10 and 3 out of 5 stars from parents!
