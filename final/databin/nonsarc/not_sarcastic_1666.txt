well, i own a new testament (only the new) book myself. so i am really surprised that you haven't seen one before.. but whatever. what i am saying, and what random dude seem to not get, is that christianity is based on the new testament. we believe in both books.. but when people ask, what is a christian? a christian is a person who believes in jesus - jesus only exist in the new testament - therefore if the new testament didn't exist, then christianity wouldn't exist either. so that is why christianity is based (remember the word based) on the gospels.
