third degree? dono posted something that confused me, so i was asking for clarification. of what concern is it to anyone whether gay people marry? adopt? what concern is it of mine whether female infants have their vaginas sewn up, for that matter? why should anyone care whether women have abortions, as well? again, where is the line drawn between concern over an issue and obsession? yay for you? there were black people who thought slavery was just fine, too, so i see this as evidence of nothing more than your own muddy thinking.
