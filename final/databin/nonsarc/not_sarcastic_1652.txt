wikipedia is really quite amazing actually. you see the fact that anybody can modify it as a reason to not trust it. that would be a valid concern if it had only a small number of contributors. but, there are millions of contributors. each going over and correcting information supplied by others. in my mind (given the current number of users) wikipedia is a fantastic peer-reviewed source of information.
