a lot of people are adopted... my science teacher was adopted. he had a successful military career that ended with him as a war planner helping to plan the gulf war... he had a successful chiropratic practice too. what you said is not so true. should he have been denied his life because of some emotional trama he might bave later in life? i don't think so.
