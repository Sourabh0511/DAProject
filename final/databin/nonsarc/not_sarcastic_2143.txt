why can't skeptics be reactionary? don't you know people who automatically distrust everything said by bush, or by liberals, or any group you like? why should skeptics be any more objective than the average population? some will be very objective, some will be very reactionary, most will fill in the spectrum in between. i belive that the majority are in the middle, you seem to be focusing on the reactionary end.
