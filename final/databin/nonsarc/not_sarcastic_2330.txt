if you want the benefits of marriage, get married. but you ought to be able to marry a person of your choice. your suggestion would be to marry someone i don't want to me married to, that is a different thing. it is not using 'that logic'. i thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you. isn't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities? i am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly. i happen to think that's a bad idea. people get married for many reasons, some of which i would feel are not good reasons, but i would not make it illegal to do so.  i am talking about the right to marry a person of your choosing.
