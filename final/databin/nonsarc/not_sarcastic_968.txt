I do not understand why people are stuck in this mindset that we have to define ALL abortions as either right or wrong. In between, there is the option of calling abortion under certain circumstances as right or wrong or calling abortion in certain trimesters as right or wrong. Why limit yourself to the extreme views? I do not believe that the original post asked for an absolute answer, just a survey of opinions. After all, as you say, abortion is not math and there is no one answer that everyone might agree with. However, the question of people's opinions on the beginning of personhood and how it relates to the morality of abortion lies at the very core of the debate on abortion rights. Really ... what other question is more relevant?
