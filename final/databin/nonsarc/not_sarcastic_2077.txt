really? congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; sounds like a requirement to be neutral to me. it could be rephrased: 'don't meddle with religion! do not regulate. neither promote nor inhibit.' why would anyone have a problem with this? and we both know that the limitation of government regulate of rights and liberties is read today, thanks to the 14th amendment, as applying to all legislative authorities in the us, not just congress. no state legislature can establish a state religion either.
