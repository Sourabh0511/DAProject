"Yeah, see this is the old ""gateway drug"" fallacy.If anything is a gateway drug, it's alcohol, so why is it still legal?If a drug can act as a ""gateway"" to other drugs, isn't that why it's illegal?So are people sitting around drinking alcohol all day, waiting for someone to come by with something ""harder""? No, and the same is true for people who smoke pot. Oh, sure they may also do other things once and a while, but it wasn't simply because they tried that first joint. It's just a personality trait and a common one. If pot didn't exist, these people would be doing something else. The same with alcohol and cigarettes. If they didn't exist, people would find some other type of vice."
