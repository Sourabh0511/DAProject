Marriage is not a religious institution. It is a government contract nothing more. Many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution. Need proof? You can get married without the permission of the church but you cant get married without the permission of the government. And because marriage is a government institution then they cannot discriminate against same sex couples and must provide the same benefits to them as is provided to straight couples. And it cannot be a separate institution either because separate is not equal.   But as I have already said this shouldnt be up for a vote. Civil rights never should be.
