Your partner wouldn't happen to be a guy, would he? As for your Christian friend, ask her to join the fray. I'd like to ask her a few questions, such as:Who do you say Jesus Christ is? If not Lord, God, Savior, and Jewish Messiah then she is on the wrong page.Ask her if people need Jesus Christ for redemption for their sins?Ask her if people should repent of their sins and turn from them?Ask her who the Holy Spirit is? If not God, then she's on the wrong page (note Acts 5).Ask her if the Bible doesn't say gay sex is a sin (Leviticus 18:22, Lev. 20:13, Romans 1:26-27; I Corinthians 6:9-10; Jude 7, etc.)? Those will do for starters.
