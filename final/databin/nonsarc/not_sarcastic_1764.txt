i'm going to presume that you are a christian. why are you a christian? because you happened to have been brought up in a christian family. why aren't you a hindu? because you weren't born in india. if you were born in india, you'd be a hindu. if you were born in central africa, you'd be believing in strange mountain gods.  use your brain, however reassuring and pleasant it is, god does not exist.  oh yeah, and why won't god heal amputees?
