what does that have to do with the issue being discussed? unless you're suggesting that for gays to refer to themselves as ethmi did is an expression of self loathing. is that the point you're trying to make? beside, by presenting a film with dick gephart and gene robinson as examples of god fearing christians, you immediately expose yourself as someone who has no concept of what a true believer in christ is. so why should a film that is nothing more than secular humanist propaganda be taken seriously at all?
