now lets add one more wrench into the anti-gun works! when the american people read, 90% of weapons come from the u.s. they are led to think, bought in an american gun store.  something even sinjin apparently believes as well. however, doing some research, i found this april 19, 2005 report that tells how u.s. weapons can end up in mexico and be things that the citizen cannot buy in a gun store. why? because they came from the u.s. government, dea and the cia. military grade weapons. now how many can be traced back to legally purchased u.s. weapons?    central america: the farc, the contras and the flow of weapons  america! get the picture now?
