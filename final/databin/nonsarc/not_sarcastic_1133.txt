Being refuted by organized groups with an agenda they support does not make Supwersports ideas wrong. You call it garbage. I AM interested in what Supersport thinks about how his ideas will get wider respect and how he thinks this will change our society.I think this is an important question, because otherwise posting here seems like a kind of mutual masterbation trading facts and arguments that have no effect.Until I hear from SS, I give him the benefit of the doubt.
