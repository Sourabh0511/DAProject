if i'm spamming a petition, then you're spamming paul krugman, darling. and i've put up plenty of rational arguments with citations. you, on the other hand, have yet to propose one reason why single payer is ridiculous. because we elect representatives to do what we say, not what the lobbyists bribe them to do. you still haven't said anything besides 'stupid', 'ridiculous', and 'maoist' or 'socialist', which is usually what people say about the few politicians who aren't on the take. emoticonxgood
