wow. just because people believe in god or claim so does not mean they have or use god as their moral compass. the god, i assume we are talking about the christian god, does not promote war and if we are to actualy follow what this god teaches and use god as our moral compass we would not go to war, but most people do not follow god as their moral compass and thus do go to war.
