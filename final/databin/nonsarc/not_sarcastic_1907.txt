i'm surprised no one has mentioned the subject of quantum mechanics in this thread. it seems to be a very good example of the concept, instead of perhaps parallel lines. the fact that things can exhibit mutually incompatible properties of either a particle or a wave depending on how we observe them is incomprehensible, yet certainly reality, no? and i think this is just one example of the apparent incomprehensibility of qm . . .
