that explains it, post 60, page 4. look what comes up for me. i have my forums settings at 40 posts per page. post 121 which came up was the first post at the top of the page.  regarding ip's, the region/part of the country or world they are from can be determined, so i'll make you an additional offer; if he shows that both easyrider and my ip's are located in the same town in nh, i'll still agree to being banned. i say this not knowing where rider is from but i assume he doesn't live in my state.
