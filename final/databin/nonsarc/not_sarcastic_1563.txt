"What's a ""marriage officer""? If that's like a priest or minister, than certainly they shouldn't have to perform a ceremony that doesn't coincide with their beliefs. But if it's a government position, like a justice of the peace, then they should either leave their religion at home when they go to work, or get a job that doesn't conflict with their beliefs. Religious freedom does not give you the freedom to deny freedom to someone else."
