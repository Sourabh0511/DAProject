do you mean when pelosi said the protestors had nazi banners, when they were actually banners saying 'no' to nazism? she's in the democrats. you mean the fantasy land whitehouse version of the proposals, that no one has actually read? no one that understands the constitution would say that, that's a very ignorant comment. what's perverted is that you think freedom of speech means the people have to shut up while they listen patiently to the government propaganda machine.
