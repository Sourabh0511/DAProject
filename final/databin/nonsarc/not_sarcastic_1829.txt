i do agree. the rot started here when thatcher came to power, and became chronic when neil kinnock became leader of the labour party. now we have two parties in hock to corporate interests, and even if another party did get elected, their hands are tied because of the reaction of the financial markets. the actions of the ecb in bailing out hedge funds is a sign of how bad it has got. i think we'd best not discuss the solution otherwise we'll start to disagree again. :p george monbiot has the beginnings of a plan in his book age of consent. i'm quite surprised you agree with what is an essentially marxist analysis of the situation though.
