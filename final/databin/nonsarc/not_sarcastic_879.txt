so what about jesus' life is credible if the source is unreliable? was it that jesus didnt walk on water but he fed 5000 with 5 loaves? was it that he didnt forgive the samaritan harlot but he raised lazarus from the dead? what did the authors get right? i mean, i can easily believe jesus said he came to bring a sword and not peace. but you dont. so how do we possibly pattern our lives according to how jesus lived if we dont know whether what they recorded was actually what he did?it is necessary to believe that the gospels are true, otherwise you cannot follow a pattrn you dont have.
