so God would rather have evil in the world than infringe freedom. how very libertarian of you, jyoshu.but actually, are evil and freedom inversely proportionate? look at the examples i gave: slavery is both evil and an infringement on human freedom. on top of that, God puts evil into people and then does not take responsibility when these people do evil things... not to mention the evil that he himself has done. murder, genocide, bigotry... the lot.if he made people with complete freedom, he MUST have made people with evil as well. why did he do that? the only reason i can come up with is that if God made everyone in his image, he himself must be evil, even partially. that that is apparent in the bible.
