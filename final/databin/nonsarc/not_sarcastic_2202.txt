the word touched me in a bad place... i think it was at summer camp or something... i'm still scarred.... no but seriously even i don't believe that... how exactly is word spiritual? is it intentional? based upon the interpretation an individual gets from it? seeing as how the history of the bible itself and it's original writings, many interpretations, denominations, and debates over itself is construed it can hardly be seen as itself being spiritual. is it possible that through god the manuscripts and texts stir inside a person a level of spirituality? yes. but when you go buy a bible at barnes and noble it certainly isn't glowing with the essence of god.... it's debated if even the ark of the covenant itself if it still exists has the essence of god to this day...
