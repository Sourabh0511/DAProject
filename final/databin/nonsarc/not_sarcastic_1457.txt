"This whole riff where people talk about preventing employers from firing gays JUST cause they are gay as a ""special right"" is something that seems to fool those who are prejudiced against gays...... but for most people, they recognize it as a propagandic phrasing with little merit.I think our laws should include something that prevents people from firing employees based on the employee's sexual orientation.But to utilize your phrasing Archie, do you think that religion is something that deserves ""special rights""?"
