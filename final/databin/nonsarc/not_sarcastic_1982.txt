Do you? Care about gay people, that is. You keep imply that it's only their tactics you don't like, but I can't recall you ever saying that you support a persons right to be gay. So please, cards on the table. Do you support a person's right to have sex with whatever willing adult they choose? No politics, no tactics. Please, just answer that simple question.
