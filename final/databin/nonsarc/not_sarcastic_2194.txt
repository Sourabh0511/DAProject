this is rather naive. who would willing condemn themselves to hell? many people commit sins regardless of the punishment. here's a little conversation to save time... i understand texas has the death penalty. are there any muders still going on? yes. why? who would condemn themselves to death? some people don't think they're going to get caught. they don't want to die themselves, but they just plain think what they do, they can get away with.
