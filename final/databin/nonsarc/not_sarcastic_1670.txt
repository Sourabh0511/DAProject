you're joking right? that's not even close. here's the verse just in case you read something else, i'll give you the benefit of the doubt with that: 1 corinthians 13:3: if i give away all i have, and if i deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, i gain nothing. this does not mean 'but not loved for it', but showing love.
