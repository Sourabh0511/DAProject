i can't vouch for what others believe. the creeds are a pretty accurate summary of my beliefs as regards who and what god is. the apostles' creed is the statement of belief used at baptism in most of christianity, so it would be strange for someone to have been baptised (or confirmed if they were baptised as an infant) without believing this to be true. to be honest i'm surprised by the idea that people (outside the pseudo-christian sects like the mormons and jehovah's witnesses) who claim to be christians would not believe what is stated in the creeds, it's not something that really occurred to me. i know that some people misunderstand the use of the word catholic in the last paragraph but that's about it.
