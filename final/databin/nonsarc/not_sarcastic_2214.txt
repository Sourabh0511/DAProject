what specifically did he say to lead you to those conclusions? i don't know what speech you heard, but i have heard romney's religion speech as well as read it, and i see nothing there that declares war on secularism, or intimated that it's only believers who offer anything of worth, or that separation of church and state is bad. (in fact he defended separation of church and state.) the text of the speech is here (among plenty of other places accessible via google search) for people to draw their own conclusions.
