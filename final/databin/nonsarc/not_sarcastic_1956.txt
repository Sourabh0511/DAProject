'diversionary tactic'? the topic was 4 july and independence day. out of curiosity, did gw sign the declaration of independence? was he the first president? he didn't lead a bunch of rebels and militia? i never said you were a socialist, that you were educated in socialist schools. the result is evident. you don't have the fortitude to go to nara and read the truth in our history archives yet you snipe around trying to change the subject which is independence day. if it happened once before in can be repeated not only here but in other countries as well...and it is!
