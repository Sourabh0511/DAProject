Actually, what gay marriage proponents simply want is to be treated like every one else. Denying the right to marriage because of his/her sexual orientation makes them second class citizens. The supporters of the anti-gay movement simply want to impose their moral values on to the rest of the public, the recent prop 8 ballot initiative proves it. Ever read John Locke or JS Mill? You should, it's what our country ideals are based on. You have your bubble and I have mine so just leave me alone; and the majority are never always right and should not have a say in what is moral or just based on their beliefs.
