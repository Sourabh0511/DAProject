"What exactly has bin Laden gained? The last I heard, some 75-80% of his top leadership is dead or in the slammer. With ""friends"" like Bush, who needs enemies? How would you like to be on the run or living in a hole for the rest of your natural days? That's the life that bin Laden lives today. He has to communicate to the outside world via courier and donkey. And tell me again, how bin Laden gains by killing Muslims? I don't quite get that part."
