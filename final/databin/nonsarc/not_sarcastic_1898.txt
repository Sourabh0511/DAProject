alright, i think i see your point know. however, i think the only way in which conservatives would be socialist is that they're soo capitalist they end up effectively swinging back to the other end of the spectrum by making people want to kill them. which is a silly argument because the proletariat ain't never rose up and not settled for simple tax breaks or what have you. furthermore, i'm intrigued by your fascism point, i'm just wondering how it affects the debate. are you saying that essentially all political ideals can effectively be reduced to the same ideology at their basest level?
