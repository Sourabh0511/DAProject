hello there, my dear fellow, you're using a 19th century definition for a 21st century subject. it doesn't work. what you're writing is pure drivel. there is the caucasian group which you initially mention, then you misuse the terminology, actually meaning the sub-ethnicities of the caucasians. no doubt you're one of those sadly misinformed individuals who believes that 'muslim' is a race. the state of education is surely at an all time low-and getting lower no doubt. cheers from the rockies emoticonxkill emoticonxhoho emoticonxcry emoticonxkill
