you mean 'junk dna' ? i think it's more than 20%, more like 95% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/junk_dna http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...-jdy052804.php http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99995063 i don't think that's what the poster was referring to, i really think he/she was ignorant of what scientists really know. basically, the fact that its there points me in the direction of evolution. also the fact that there are conserved regions of dna within codons and exons points me toward evolution as the explanation. oh, now i see! of course they know what their own acronym stands for. they also know why they named the bases a (adenine) g (guanine) t (thymine) c (cytosine) u (uracil). they named them when they were discovered. i think the poster was saying they don't know how they work, which is quite false. of course, the mechanism of protein transcription has been known for quite some time.
