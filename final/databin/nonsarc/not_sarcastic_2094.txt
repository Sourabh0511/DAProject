i've spoken favorably of religious believers who stand up for gay rights against a tyrannical version of christianity. what more do you want? blood? look, i disagree with the entire concept of religion. my view is that when religious believers support something that's right, they do it despite their religion, because it makes sense to them on the basis of humanitarian instincts, not religious ones. maybe sometimes their religion coincides with humanitarianism. all i can say to that is i wish it would do it more often than it does in practice!
