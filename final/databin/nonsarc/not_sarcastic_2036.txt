this an example of what i am saying you choose to ignore the moral command from the ot to burn witches whereas in the middle ages that moral command was followed this passage also mentions that you must pay taxes as well, are you rebelling against god if you complain about the redistribution of wealth through taxation if it set by the governing authority ? i also believe that passage can cause all sorts of problems, for example a fascist regime is a governing authority should you submit to a government that is morally unjust ?  bad in general, and no i don't think the same. as i said i have started to modify my socialist principles, i have a great sympathy for the anarchist way of thinking. where the state is a way to oppress the masses.
