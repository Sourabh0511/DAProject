i'm surprised that some people still aren't aware of what the chinese have done to upgrade their country. sure, certain areas like the financial sector are still lagging (which is why they won't float the yuan just yet), but when it comes to industry and infrastructure they're done a most admirable job. does anybody here also think it's kinda funny that a communist country is beating the us at their own game (i.e. capitalism)?
