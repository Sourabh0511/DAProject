obviously i don't have a perfect memory or even that i read what you are referring to. why don't you give me a flavor of their 'factual errors?' and are you talking about their news sections or their opinion pieces? and who wrote it? sometimes in the opinion pieces these are submitted by authors in the nations that are the subject. perhaps this was written by a swedish politician who had an ax to grind.
