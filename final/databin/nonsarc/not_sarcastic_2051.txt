ok, great so far. we're getting some good predictions on both sides. i think this is going to be a lot of fun to look back at in time. keep it up. more topics... cap and trade. will strict controls be placed? what effects if so? iraq. will he pull out? what happens then? (with iraq or terror here or whatever) how much $$$ will he throw at the economic crisis? what will the outcome be? anything you all want to predict or comment on concerning the upcoming presidency will be appreciated. have fun!
