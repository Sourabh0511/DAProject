who said pregnancy is the only bad thing? we already talked about ceverical cancer. furthermore, condoms don't always work...bad protection. maybe not, but wearing a bright red sign that says 'stalk me' sure will get the ones that are out there. your limited world shield you from the realities of life...which is really a bad thing i suppose but it gives a better reason to listen to your parents. aren't you a warm-hearted person you are in cancun talking to people on a pointless forum... does anyone else think this is rather odd?
