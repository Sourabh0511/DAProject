ephesians does indeed talk of salvation through faith created in christ jesus unto good works(2:10). i must admit that im not totally sure what this means, that faith leads to good works? id dispute that. whilst most of romans does talk of salvation through faith, romans 2:6 says however god will render to every man according to his deeds. in the end, the point is moot. i dont really care if the bible does say that man is justified by faith alone (and it doesnt conclusively), my point is that i am unwilling to worship a creature that justifies only by faith anyway.
