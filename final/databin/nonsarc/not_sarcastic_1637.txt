okay, i guess i'll have to watch the new batman movies soon. what did you think of the opening scene to x2? with nightcrawler trying to assassinate the president? one of my favorite scenes from any movie. yeah, each spider-man movie was worse. last i heard, they are planning a complete reboot without tobey or raimi.
