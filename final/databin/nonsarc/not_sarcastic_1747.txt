he was a partial-birth abortion provider that killed babies late term. in terms of fetal viability he might as well been killing babies right after they'd been born. i don't condone it, but i'm surprised it didn't happen sooner--one monster killed by another. it wasn't right, but what that sicko doctor was doing was certainly no better.
