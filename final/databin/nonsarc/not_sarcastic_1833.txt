darling, you're too sensitive. i've never had an issue with your debates. it was a parody of some of the new ones out. you've probably seen them, they ask a question then give yes, because and no, because for the answers when they are clearly not a question that can be answered yes or no. if i had a problem with yours, i'd be enough of a friend to kindly point it out. again, you're cool with me, don't worry.edit: i see where you've seen what i was referring to. it's early here and i'm not yet awake. but i have to get crank-started and get ready for class.
