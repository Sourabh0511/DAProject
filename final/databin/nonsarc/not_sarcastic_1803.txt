i think in the mind of a psychopath with boundary issues, what the woman was wearing, or where she was at does not matter at all. how do you explain people who get raped in their homes? how about people who aren't dressing slutty, they're just having a drink with a friend, but that friend turns out to have a darkside? i really hope you're joking though.
