And what if he had said fiance? Would you have suddently admitted that their love is real? Pointing out a different word choice than you would have used doesn't appear to mean anything.If you are certain that their love is not real, why don't you explain your reasoning that led you to this conclusion? It seems to me that a gay person knows his own love better than someone who has never even met that gay person. Do you have some knowledge which disagrees?
