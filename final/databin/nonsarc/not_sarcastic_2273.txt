Yes, and George Dubya Bush and the GOP know it's unconstitutional.Would it really bother you so much if the feds recognized a Massachusetts or California or New York or New Jersey same-sex marriage while other states like Alabama and Utah could ban same-sex marriage?I could live with that. Most gay people already leave those states anyway.
