as i recall the order of feet was left front foot, right hind foot, left hind foot, and finally right front foot. does that make you happy. oh yes the genes involved are known as peds and numbered in order 1-4. ped1 and ped4 are mirror images of each other (obtained by a process known as reflective copy) and ped2 and ped3 are much the same. this is of course entirely logical and could have been directed or random. the first critter to bear such feet was known as the ftse not to be confused with the index. its predecessors were of course the gimpy series since they had 1,2, or 3 feet and had to hobble along with what they had. ftse-1 is sometimes known as pogo because of its odd 'gait'.
