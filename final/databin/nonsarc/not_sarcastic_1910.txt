however, just because the majority of people share something in common doesn't always mean the truth? very good. philosophers call this type of argument 'argumentum ad populum'. it is a fallacy that many people are prone to commit. you can choose a sonnet and correctly pick's its emotion but you can never be so sure i agree. shakespearean scholars often disagree about very miniscule details. but i think just because they are not 'sure', that doesn't mean that they can't be certain. maybe you could go google 'shakespeare sonnet 1' and read just the first poem of his sonnets collection. tell me what you think! i'm sure that shakespeare will charm you like he has charmed so many.
