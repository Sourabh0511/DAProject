"Now you are confusing me. In a previous post, you wrote this: ""A gay couple has no more right to marry then two brothers""But now you say that you never said there ""is no right to same sex marriage."" So are you arguing that two brothers do have the right to marry? I am reading your posts, but you seem to make contradictory arguments. That may be because I just don't understand what you are writing.I thought you were arguing that there is no right of same-sex couples to marry but that they should be allowed to marry anyway. It sounded like a nuanced argument to me. But apparently that is not what you were saying? Can you clarify this?Thanks."
