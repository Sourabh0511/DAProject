here's the thing about stem cell research... how would stem cell research go against the christian faith. does it go against christ to heal the sick? medicnes could improve greatly with the use of stem cell research. i'll quicky mention 2 people (1 still alive and one dead) who could have (or could be) greatly healed with stem cell research. for one, christerpher reeves could have still been alive if stem cell research could have been done. michael j. fox (and others with parkingson's (sp?) disease) could be greatly helped with the use of stem cell research. oh, and one other thing. bush has no family values. not just tearing apart gay families but also straight families. he sends husbands/fathers, wives/mother's, sons and daughters over to fight a war that we have no business in being in anyway.
