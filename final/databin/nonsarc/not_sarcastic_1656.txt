having been raised in texas as a child and teen, with many relatives still residing there, i'm surprised their educational system hasn't gone to the bible as its primary textbook. perhaps things have changed, but fundamentalist hypocrisy was at one time the law of the land in texas. maybe since texans are no longer served by oklahoma and louisiana bootleggers the fire and brimstone circuit has relaxed, but i'd find that difficult to believe as religion is a very effective control technique.
