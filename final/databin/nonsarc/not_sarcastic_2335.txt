you guys just don't get it do you? this isn't about an attack on christianity. this isn't about anti-christians, and in the end, this isn't about the cross, or any other religious symbol for that matter, offending anyone. this is about keeping religion from meddling with government, but just as, if not more, important, it is about keeping government from meddling with religion, and the moment they intertwine, there are possibilities for many dangerous things to happen. and by the way, i'm a christian, and i don't want my government in any way defining any part of what i hold dear. p.s. sandycane- most buddhists aren't in india.
