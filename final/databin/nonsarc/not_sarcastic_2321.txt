now isn't that a terribly socialistic position to take? but, i'm confused by it at the same time, for socialists like you don't really want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs now do you? emoticonxrolleyes when logic fails, there's alway ad hominem, right? and the ad hominen continues..... we're larger, more diverse, more litigious, need i go on? leaving the continued ad hominem aside, one of the causes for our high healthcare costs is litigation. since the dnc survives on the money derived from the blood-sucking trial lawyers lobby, i don't see real reform occurring until we cut those purse strings along with the big pharma's.
