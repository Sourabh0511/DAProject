i feel the opposite is true. i feel a lack of hierarchy adds complication to the layout. it's pretty functional don't get me wrong. freaking cool site, but i mean you have all this opportunity to explore hierarchy and color (brand = two colors, blue/orange, arguments has 2 choices...). they even dabbled in it a little with the 'add argument' buttons above. the grid structure of the layout seems mildly confusing as well. for instance, the vertical alignments of usernames with their respective arguments could match up more uniquely to aid in clarity. or if the leading (space between lines of text) wasn't so consistent, each 'argument' might be better framed visually, without the addition of graphics or color. obviously, this is not gospel or some fantastic soultion, i just think lack of color could be one of a few ideas on improving clarity and functionality of the site.
