i would never limit myself in a debate to 'how many' generations it takes because the fact is your scientists are afraid to test such things. in the following example it took between 7 and 18 generations for guppies to change their phenotypes. http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...sss-270397.php of course these guys, being evolutionsts explain this phenomenon as happening through natural selection -- death. but what have we already learned about tadpoles?? -- they develop in direct relation to their predators....including body structure. fish are no different.
