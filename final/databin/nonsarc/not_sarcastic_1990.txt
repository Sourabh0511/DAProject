what makes you think they're not true? jesus arose from the dead. that's one of the most well attested to facts in ancient history, whether you want to casually sweep it under the rug or not.  many skeptics set out to prove the story of christ to be a fairy tale. none succeeded and a number became believers. you guys are playing with absolute fire. if you're wrong (and you are), you're screwed big time. big time and forever. do you feel lucky? well, do you?
