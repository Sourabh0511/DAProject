your right about the 14 year old and the ten year old but if it is a 18 and 14 should that be legal? or 18 and 15? 16 and 21 is legal (although it is wrong) because the youngest one is still legal. age of consent = 16 years old. if your basing it on a year gap what about 10 years? i am 10 years older than my fiance. before anyone jumps to conclusions i am 38. and she is 28. legal? why? we are both over 16.......period.
