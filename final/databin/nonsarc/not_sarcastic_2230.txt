so what? jefferson is a prime example in opposites and double standards. he believed in freedom but owned slaves. wrote the declaration of independence yet only believed in freedom for white men not women or people of color. this stance is very consistent with his double standard. he was also an adulterous, womanizer who had sex with his slave women and producing children who would remain slaves. so there again is his double standard he enslaved his own children.
