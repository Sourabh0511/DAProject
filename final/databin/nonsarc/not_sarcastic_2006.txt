You failed to answer a question. Have you had an abortion? I'm not arguing against abortion or for it, I'm arguing against your faulty premise that the abortion debate can't be related to slavery. Cite your source on that APA study. Because I found multiple sources that say while some women feel relieved, others have emotional problems. I would like to know whether these women had early or late-term abortions. Either way, I doubt the majority is relieved.
