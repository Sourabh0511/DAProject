Why do you think they feel no emotion? All the women I know who have aborted did so under very difficult circumstances and it was horrible for them.Most women who seek abortion are not unfeeling sluts. They are real women, with real issues, and real circumstances that lead them to that choice. Want to help those babies? Address the issues the women face and don't demonize. No amount of legislation can make for succesful pregnancy without the support of the mother. Dismiss her and you will fail to do anything to help anyone.
