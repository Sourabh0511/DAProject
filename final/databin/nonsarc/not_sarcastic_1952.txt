that seems to beg the question. be convinced one way or the other as much as you like, but if you can't prove your position, or even provide evidence for it, then how can you possibly use it to justify anything? yes, people's religious beliefs influence them. what shooter seems to be asking is if that's in any way reasonable? if you're basing your entire life on some point, should you be able to show that your beliefs about that point are true? put another way, it's kinda dumb to base major life decisions on a feeling, isn't it?
