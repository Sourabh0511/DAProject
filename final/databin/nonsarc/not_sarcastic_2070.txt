there's a fair few problems with this. off the top of my head... what happens when the pregnancy is accidental, and neither the mother nor the father want a child? what consequences would there be for a mother who didn't want to give the name of the father? would there be any? why is only the father punished? having consensual sex is just that - consensual on the part of both people. if it isn't consensual, rape laws already cover it and if it is consensual and a pregnancy occurs, why punish only one of the consenting individuals? on a more fundamental level: what evidence do you have that having an abortion is 'a mortal sin'? why should the courts be concerned with preventing a religious concept?
