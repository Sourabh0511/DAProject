i'm kind of amused by the idea that the king james version is the most accurate, there are a lot of fairly well documented flaws, like the introduction of unicorns into the old testament. you also seem to imply that modern translations were dreamed up by a couple of drunken biblical scholars with nothing better to do on a friday evening, whereas most are at least as rigorously researched as the kjv, and often with a greater number of sources available.
