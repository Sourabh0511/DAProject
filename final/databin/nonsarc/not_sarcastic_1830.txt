economic understanding does not come from a series of graphs and equations that come from a man who has no understanding of how humans work. the economy is not some mechanical machine, it is an organic mass of all 7 billion people of the world making millions decisions every day. behind all the smoke and mirrors, all this man said was this, in other words, concluded bullshit is still bullshit.  and your second point, companies also compete on a technological level, if they aren't as advanced as their competitors they generally go out of business because people want the better quality/cheaper product. what is the states incentive? getting re-elected? oh wait, thats easy to do when 95% of voters have no clue as to what is going on and only think about politics for 5 minutes during the elections.
