i think this is something everyone on here can get behind. at least i would hope so. saying that fred phelps is an embarrassment to this nation and my home state would be a gross understatement. sadly, i can't say i'm surprised by this, but i definitely don't think i would have ever predicted it. what he is doing is despicable. and what the patriot guard is doing is amazing. i like the sentiment involved in attempting to pass laws against protesting at funerals (although i don't know if they'll hold up in court), i only wish they had felt the same when he was protesting aids victims.
