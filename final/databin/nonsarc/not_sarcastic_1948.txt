I don't believe that Orthodox doctrine deals directly with WWII. I am unfamiliar with such. Are you saying that the event you stated had a direct bearing on the cause of the war?Our doctrine would deal with evil, in general. But there may be Orthodox writers who have commented on the war. We are a Church with doctrine, but it would take more than a number of writers commenting on something to make it a 'doctrine'.Armenia was the first nation on earth to adopt Christianity.
