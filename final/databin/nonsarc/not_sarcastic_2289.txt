do you realize, that the fetus has only recently not been defined as a human being. back when birth control first came out, planed parenthood wanted to make sure it would be leagle. so they redefined 'life' to say that you had to draw breth. by the way have you ever seen any pictures of the aborted babies? 'cause they sure like humans to me. you know most of them can already move before the abotion? look into the court hearings of judge ricard c. caey in new york. if you want to know the truth about abortion.
