correct. did you notice that in the scott peterson trial, the judge went around the law in deciding how he should be punished and who has rights? a clear sign of activism, yet none of the righties called him a activist judge even when what he did is by defintion activism. it's a sign they are hugely hypocritical.  vor's got a raging double standard if he calls some judges who do that activist and others who do the same, not.
