i'm not really surprised at the bush administrations lack of a forest management plan. he known for not being an enviromentally-friendly president. forest fires are usually a natural occurance. they are often good for the eco-systems.it's the man made disasters that are the problem. we can't stop forest fires, but we can keep the property damage to a minimum by thining forests, building access roads where posible to fight the fires, and have stricter control over timber harvests. often the timber companies over-cut certain areas, leaving the lanscape a barren, lifeless terrain, not suited for wildlife habitat. soil erosion can become a problem also, as the silt from the soil erosion pollutes the streams and damages the fish habitat. the government needs a good forest management plan for public lands, and more funding for personel to impliment the current programs of forest management.
