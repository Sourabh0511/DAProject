just how many cases do you want to read that says exactly what i am quoting? i just gave you a taste of things to come...like the right to be left alone. even the 10 year census, all that is required by the xivth amendment i: 1. number of people who live there 2. sex of each 3. age of each that completes the enumeration and registration for the census. i will ask the 3rd time before i cover you up with cases, show me the enumerated power of any branch of government to require a person to register any right, much less firearms.
