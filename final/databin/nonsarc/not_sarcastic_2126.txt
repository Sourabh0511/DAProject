so you argue that for some women, abortion is the 'easy way out', and that those women choose to abort, take the easy way out as you say, for arbitrary reasons? could you please reiterate these reasons here (preferably in an enumerated list) and explain why they should be considered arbitrary? indeed. but we've established that supposing a higher profile in the media in no way entails an actual increase in incidents.  so i'll repeat the question, hearsay aside, upon what evidence do you base the assertion that more women are abandoning infants?
