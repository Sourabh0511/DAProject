That's a completely different issue jo. If those pro gay sites were accurately translating and interpreting the bible as it intended itself to be translated, I would accept it with open arms. But how can I accept the lies that homosexual apologists attempt to tell by distorting Gods truth in order to justify their sin? You should understand that I can't allow that rather than you using those corrupted sources in order to support what you personally want the bible to say. I welcome anyone to take the content of the links that tell each story within my link above, and disregard the info if any opposing info is found regarding the claims they make. But just attacking it because it's a jewish source is ridiculous.
