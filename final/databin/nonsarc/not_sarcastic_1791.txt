wow, thats pretty cool, not that i can afford it or anything. and i doubt it will be as common as the regular car is.  i'm serious about the broccoli though, you would think with all the amazing technology on this planet we could find a way to make healthy food taste good. instead we are making unhealthy food taste like crap.  think about it, broccoli is one of the most healthy foods on the planet, if you ate a full serving of broccoli every day it would increase your longevity by years. now imagine if it tasted just like hershey's milk chocolate.
