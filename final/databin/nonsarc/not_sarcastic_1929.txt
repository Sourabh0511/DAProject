Umm.. again they are identified as Messianic Jewish. Google 'Messianic Jewish' if you care, thousands of hits. So you now try to personally misidentify this 'Jewish' group on your own terms? A Messianic Jew is a Jewish person who believes that Yeshua (Jesus) is their Messiah. Some people (You) think that a Jewish person who believes in Jesus is no longer a Jew. But what could possibly be more Jewish than believing in the Jewish Messiah, Yeshua? But anyway, that is NOT the point, the point is the same as I made before: The fact that there are Messianic Jews shows exactly what I was outlining in the top post. You seem to be inferring that I am suggesting that such 'change' means a change for ALL Jews, sic, obviously I am not suggesting that.
