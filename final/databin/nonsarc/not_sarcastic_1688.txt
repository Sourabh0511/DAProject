simone darling, please stop. your making yourself look foolish. your trying to compare uniformed soldiers in an organized military under civilian gov't control to terrorists. there is no comparison to be made here, even you should be able to see that. huh? the u.s. military dismantled some of our bases in saudi arabia based on a prearranged schedule at the behest of the saudi government. it had nothing to do with 'capitulating to the taliban', nor did we remove all of our bases. yes simone, we still have military bases in saudi arabia.
