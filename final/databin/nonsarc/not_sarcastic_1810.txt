i'm surprised at the density of posters still attempting to tie zarqawi to saddam's government or (prior to us occupation resistance) al qaeda. his actions in iraq prior to the us invasion were limited to kurdish territory, where saddam was attempting to contain that rebellion, and zarqawi was never a disciple of bin laden. zarqawi's bio has been reviewed on the internet many, many times: http://www.weeklystandard.com/conten...4/094npvzg.asp as to al qaeda training camps in saudi arabia, they do exist in spite of publicized saud government attempts to eliminate them. even the most naive poster with even a minute understanding of the saud steel grip on their nation should be able to comprehend that if the sauds didn't want something, it wouldn't be there. and need i mention pakistan? http://www.wtnh.com/global/story.asp?s=1381324 http://www.nationalreview.com/commen...0402090859.asp
