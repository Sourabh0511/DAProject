Forgive me if this seems picky, but I just want to try and fully understand this argument. I should say that I don't necessarily agree with it, and would like to respond as to why. I just want to give a proper representation of your argument so that I can make a sound response.As such, you can no more force her, against her will, to provide bodily resources to an embryo or fetus, than you can yourself be forced to give of your bodily resources against your will.... Where does this right originate from, i.e., is it from the US Constitution via the 14th amendment etc?
