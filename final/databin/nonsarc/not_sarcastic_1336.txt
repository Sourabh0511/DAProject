Let me explain this to you.You want to stop abortions for someone else. You want to take a womans right to choose away. Where as Jito supporting a womans right to choose does not impose upon your life in any way.You want to stop me from being able to marry this does not effect your life in any way yet has a devastationg effect on my life. The left supports rights while your side want to limit the rights of others.You want to stop me from being able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though I may have a religious belief that supports it. Therefore you are imposing your religious and moral views on me when I do not share those beliefs.
