along with some others here, you have missed the point. i know we all have the ability to file extensions for various reasons. i don't really care how much money they have. more power to them for being filthy rich. a candidate for president is supposed to reveal his (and spouse's) tax returns. teresa has apparently asked for an extension just to have it revealed after the convention. why?  is there anything to hide that would hurt kerry's chances of even being nominated? this has nothing to do with the average citizen.
