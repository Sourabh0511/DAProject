even with tax deductible status, i seriously doubt there's enough of a market available yet to make privatization a going concern. since all people will ostensibly benefit from whatever flows from the space program, it seems like government is still the only option now. sure, the russians are capitalizing on their experience by taking citizens for rides, but what are they really learning or advancing there? they're getting more and more vocal about us funding their stupid space station. the europeans are primarily interested in the lucrative satellite-launching business; again, where's the hard science? so it seems to fall to the americans -- surprise. but if we don't do it, the chinese certainly will. in all probabilities, they will be fierce competitors, imo.
