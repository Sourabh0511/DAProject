When it comes to all the examples that Behe had provided in both his first book, and his second book , it has been shown to be able to evolve naturally.   That means, in principle, IC systems can evolve. If you don't believe so, bring forth the I.C. system of your choice.   To say 'But you don't know all the answers' is just the logical fallacy known as 'argument from ignorance'.   Behe brings a system up that he claims is IC.. the pathway for evolution is discovered, and Behe trys another one. How dishonest can you get?   The concept is falsified.
