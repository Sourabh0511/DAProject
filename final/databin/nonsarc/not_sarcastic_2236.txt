so you are asking how a gravitational field overcomes the intertia of a less massive object placed within said field? i don't know but your question kind of confused me: in this example the only reason the object is not moving is because you are exerting an opposing force to counter that which the warped space has induced on the object (gravity). all that has changed when the object is released is it can accelerate freely and we can observe the resulting notion. i see what you are getting at- the question could be rephrased as how is an object in a region of warped space constantly under an acceleration towards the centre of the gravitional field, the strength of which depends upon the size of the bodies and the distance separating the two?
