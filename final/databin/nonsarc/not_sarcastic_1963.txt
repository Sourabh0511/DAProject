hmmm, the employment, housing, and accommodation thing is really state based and for employment i am pretty sure every state doesn't allow you to ask about sexual orientation.  as for marriage...anyone is allowed to marry (so long as they are of age). you just have a problem with the definition of marriage. as for the military thing...seems like a complicated issue. where does a gay man shower for example? the womans bathroom? there own special bathroom? the mens bathroom? other issues involving relationships could arise as well. as for the adoption thing...only florida doesn't allow it outright.
