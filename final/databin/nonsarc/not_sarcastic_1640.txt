final, switzerland 1 spain 0. spain, one of the favorites or perhaps the favorite to win the world cup, loses to switzerland. what a shocker. of course with two more matches for all teams in this group anything can happen, but the pressure is on spain. they can not afford to lose another game, even a tie could mean not getting to the round of sixteen.emoticonxwow
