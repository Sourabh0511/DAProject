mike, you seem to imply that the story in genesis is false (whether intentionally or not), yet you accept the rest of the bible as true in its entirety? what about the flood, the plagues, the exodus on a whole? what about the other miraculous and unscientifically supernatural phenomenon that the bible describes? do you believe that these events took place at all? the bible does not only oppose science's theories of universal origin, it also opposes a huge amount of natural laws of physics. would you say that the bible is true and the events in it really occured?
